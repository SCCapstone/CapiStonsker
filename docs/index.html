  <h1>Why this app?</h1>
    
    <div>
      <p>
        This app provides users with an interactive and fun way to enagage with the history of their local community and has something to offer to many different types of users. For instance, someone who is new to a community within South Carolina can use this app to learn about the local history, to find safe and fun places to go on a walk, and to have a reason to get out and meet their neighbors. A history teacher could use this app to assign students relevant historical landmarks to visit and track their progress using our friends feature. At the same time, a family could use this app to take an educational and fun walk around their neighborhood or a history could use it to track their progress in visiting every historical landmark in the county. No matter who you are, if you live in South Carolina and are a little curious, this app provides a fun and safe way to engage with your community and learn something along the way. No matter your age or background, this app has a place on your phone.

  <h1>How can our app be used?</h1>
    
    <div>
      <p>
        Our application opens on a map screen, centered on the user's current location and populated with any nearby historical landmarks. From there, a user can tap any marker to learn more, to visit it, or to save it for later (if logged in). A user can also search for markers by name or filter by county, that user's personal wishlist, or visited markers. If a user prefers a list view, there is a button conveniently located to the bottom right of the home screen that goes to a list view of the map page, with markers sorted by proximity to the user, that has the same searching and filtering options as the home page. A user can also access the side menu from the bottom left hand button at any time. From the side menu, a user can log in, plan a route to multiple markers, connect with friends, and track their own progress in visiting markers as well as the progress of friends. A user can also populate their account with a bio, display name, and picture, and there is a help page if the user has any questions in addition to a tutorial that opens the first time a user uses the app. Our app can be used by a variety of people, as indicated in the "Why this app?" section above, for a wide array of purposes to allow any user to learn something while at the same time having the opportunity to meaningfully engage with his or her communuity.

The law promised to improve rural S.C. roads, but many of those sentenced to hard labor had committed petty crimes and most were African American. A 1920 report found that the Allendale chain gang suffered poor and unsanitary conditions. Some inmates at the Allendale Jail served on road gangs well into the 20th century. ALLENDALE CO. JAIL (Reverse) In 1919 the S.C. General Assembly issued $100,000 in bonds to fund construction of a jail and courthouse in the newly established Allendale County. Both were designed by Atlanta-based architect G. Lloyd Preacher, a Fairfax, S.C. native and graduate of Clemson College. The courthouse and jail were completed in 1922. The jail, which once stood here, housed not only prisoners, but also the jailer and jail administrator. The Allendale Co. Jail remained in use until 1971. Sponsored by Allendale County, 2016",

RAILROADS IN SIMPSONVILLE (Reverse) Main Street was laid out parallel to the tracks, and the railroad ushered in a period of rapid growth and prosperity. The G&L RR and its successor the Port Royal & Western Carolina Railway were absorbed by the Charleston & Western Carolina Railway in 1896. The Atlantic Coast Line RR took control of the C&WC in 1897 and operated it until 1959. The first passenger and freight depot here was demolished in the 1970s.

(Reverse) The seminary opened here in 1834, with Dr. Ernest L. Hazelius (1777-1853), a native of Prussia who had come to America in 1800, as headmaster until 1851.

The fair, sponsored by the State Agricultural Society, featured agricultural, mechanical, household, and art exhibits. During the Civil War a Confederate \u201ccamp of instruction\u201d and hospital were here 1861-63, then a lab for making medicines and a branch of the Nitre & Mining Bureau, 1863-65. All the buildings were burned by Federal troops in February 1865. (Reverse) In 1869 the State Fair was revived by the State Agricultural & Mechanical Society, which hoped to \u201cbeautify Carolina homes and enliven Carolina hearths.\u201d The new fair added carnival attractions and rides as it grew in size and attendance over the next 34 years. The 1903 State Fair was the last here, as the site was too small and the buildings too old to accommodate it. The State Fair moved to its present location south of downtown Columbia in 1904.

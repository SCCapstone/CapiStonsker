S.C. HWY. 184 AT THE LITTLE RIVER, JUST NORTHEAST OF ITS INTERSECTION WITH S.C. SEC. RD. 1-59, DUE WEST VICINITY 
ACTION AT PRATT’S MILL (Front) The last action of the Revolution in this part of S.C. was at Pratt’s Mill, a grist mill on the Little River owned by Joseph Pratt. On October 30, 1781, an outpost of 30 Patriots at the mill, under Capt. John Norwood, was surprised by 30 Loyalists and Cherokees under Col. William “Bloody Bill” Cunningham. Norwood, who was wounded, was the only casualty on either side. PRATT’S MILL (Reverse) The Patriots fled, leaving behind 30 horses and most of their weapons; the Loyalists burned the mill. The Pratt family later rebuilt the mill, which appears in Robert Mills’s Atlas of S.C. (1825). They later built another mill on Hogskin Creek, about 500 yds. N of the first mill. That mill, which operated throughout the 19th century, was destroyed by a flood in 1908. Erected by the Abbeville County Historical Society, 2007

SECESSION AVE., NEAR ITS JUNCTION WITH BRANCH ST., ABBEVILLE 
(Front) On November 22, 1860, a mass meeting on this site was one of the first held in the South after Abraham Lincoln’s election as president on November 6. A procession from the town square, numbering 2,000 to 3,000, made its way to a grove here, near the Greenville & Columbia RR depot. Many in the crowd wore palmetto cockades as bands played, militia and volunteer companies marched with flags and banners, and some units even fired cannon salutes. (Reverse) Andrew G. Magrath, arguing “the time for action has arrived,” was typical of most speakers, who called for South Carolina’s immediate secession from the Union. The meeting passed resolutions urging secession and recommended delegates to represent Abbeville District at the Secession Convention in December. This hill, then known as “Magazine Hill” for a powder magazine here, was soon renamed “Secession Hill” and has been known by that name since 1860.

WASHINGTON ST., JUST SOUTH OF HEMPHILL RD., ABBEVILLE 
COLONIAL BLOCK HOUSE (Front) A “block house,” a log building with a stone foundation, stood SE on Parker Creek from ca. 1767 to the 1850s. It was built by Andrew Pickens (1739-1817), later a militia general in the American Revolution, a state representative and senator, and a U.S. Congressman. Pickens married Rebecca Calhoun in 1765, moved to the Long Canes settlement, and built his home nearby.

1-19 TREATY OF LOCHABER 
S.C. HWY 71, ABBEVILLE VICINITY 
(Front) In October 1770, the Congress of Lochaber assembled near here at the plantation of Alexander Cameron, who was deputy superintendant of Indian affairs for the southern colonies. Over one thousand members of the Cherokee nation gathered for the treaty negotiations. The resulting agreement revised the boundary line between the Cherokee and the colony of Virginia further to the north. (Reverse) The new boundary, which became known as the Lochaber Line, extended colonial land claims west of the Appalachian Mountains. These claims had generated tension between colonists and the crown since the Proclamation of 1763, which limited western settlement and angered land speculators. The Treaty of Lochaber was part of the long negotiation to extend the southern segment of the boundary further to the west. Sponsored by the Abbeville County Visitor’s Council, 2014

On May 20, 1777 the parties signed The Treaty of DeWitt’s Corner, which provided for an end to hostilities, prisoner returns, and large land concessions by the Lower Cherokee. (Reverse) The territory ceded included present day Anderson, Greenville, Oconee and Pickens Counties. The warfare ended by the Treaty of DeWitt’s Corner was part of the revolutionary struggle between American patriots and their British and loyalist opponents. The powerful southeastern Indian nations played an important role in the war and most sided with the British. Sponsored by the Abbeville County Visitor’s Council, 2014

(Front) The tracks of the S.C. Railroad, operated by the S.C. Canal & Railroad Company, ran here from 1833 to the 1850s. The company, chartered in 1827, began constructing a 136-mile long line 8 from Charleston to Hamburg (near North Augusta) in 1830. Completed in 1833, the railroad was the longest in America at the time and the first to carry the United States mails. Aiken, chartered in 1835, was named for William Aiken (1779-1831), the railroad’s first president. (Reverse) The original tracks through Aiken, one of the first “railroad towns” in the United States, ran along this street, then known as Railroad Avenue. Railroad Avenue was renamed Park Avenue in the 1850s after the tracks were moved one block south into the “Railroad Cut.” Though the S.C. Railroad flourished before the Civil War, it struggled during Reconstruction and afterwards. It was eventually absorbed into the Southern Railway in 1902.

(Front) This mill, the largest textile mill in antebellum S.C., was chartered in 1845 and opened in 1847. It was founded by William Gregg (1800-1867), a Virginia native and advocate of industrial development who chose this site for its proximity to waterpower, granite deposits, and the S.C. Railroad. The company provided housing, a school, a store, and land for churches, creating a model mill village. Unlike most early textile mills, it was adequately funded. (Reverse) Under Gregg's management early Graniteville families lived under strict rules and a rigid schedule, and became a close-knit community. During the Civil War the mill made fabrics for the Confederacy. After Gregg died in 1867 while fighting a flood on Horse Creek the company was run by its board, which expanded its operations. After several changes in ownership Graniteville remains one of the oldest textile manufacturing concerns in the South. Erected by the Aiken County Historical Society, 2001

It was named for William Aiken (1779-1831), the first president of the S.C. Canal and Railroad Co. Aiken’s mild climate and accessibility by rail soon made it a health resort for visitors hoping to escape the summer heat or seeking relief from tuberculosis and other lung ailments. (Reverse) On Feb. 11, 1865, Federal and Confederate cavalry clashed here in the Battle of Aiken. The city’s resort status was enhanced in the 19th and 20th centuries with its fame as a “Winter Colony,” created by wealthy Northerners who built houses and sports facilities such as golf courses, polo fields, racetracks, and stables. Aiken later experienced a significant population boom in the 1950s after the construction and opening of the Savannah River Plant. Erected by the Aiken County Historical Society, 2003

(Front) The Hamburg Massacre, which occurred nearby on July 8, 1876, was one of the most notable incidents of racial and political violence in S.C. during Reconstruction. White Democrats across the state organized “rifle clubs” to intimidate black and white Republicans during the gubernatorial election of 1876. Clashes between groups of armed men were frequent, in some cases even including the militia. (Reverse) After a dispute between whites and a black militia company, about 200 men from local rifle clubs tried to disarm 38 black militiamen and others barricaded in a warehouse. One white was killed and men on each side were wounded before the blacks fled. Two blacks were killed trying to escape. Whites captured 25-30 blacks and executed four of them. 87 whites were charged in the massacre but were never tried for it. Erected by the Heritage Council of North Augusta, 2010

It was deeded to the town of Aiken in 1844 by William Perroneau Finley (1803-1876) and furnished Aiken’s drinking water throughout the 19th century. A regular stop on the stagecoach route from Abbeville to Charleston, it helped make Aiken a popular health resort. William Gilmore Simms described it in 1843 as “a fountain of delicious water, which is equally cold and unfailing.” (Reverse) The brick springhouse, covered in stucco, dates from the early 19th century and features Greek Revival architectural elements. During the Civil War Confederate soldiers camped nearby, in what is now Hitchcock Woods, were frequent visitors. The springhouse and retaining walls, neglected by the turn of the 20th century, were restored in 1972 after archaeological excavations. Coker Spring was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Erected by the Brig. Gen. Barnard E. Bee Camp #1575, Sons of Confederate Veterans, 2011

(Front) This African-American community was established in 1930 after two floods on the Savannah River washed away most of the town of Hamburg. That town had become a predominantly African-American community after the Civil War. Carrsville was most likely named for Charles W. Carr of the American Red Cross or for William Carpenter, an African-American businessman, both of whom gave lots for new homes here to families displaced by the flooding. (Reverse) Boylan Street here was originally named Red Cross Street in recognition of that organization’s aid to the black families who had lost their homes on the banks of the Savannah River. This building, long called “the Society Building,” was built in 1930 for the Young Men’s Union Society, which later bought the lot from William Carpenter. The building has hosted many events for organizations such as Simmons Lodge No. 571, which acquired it in 1988. Sponsored by the Heritage Council of North Augusta, 2014

S.C. HWY. 389, EAST OF PERRY 
“THE MIDDLE ROAD” (Front) This road likely began as a Native American trading path that ran from the Savannah River to Charleston. A statute of 1770 established it as a public road. It ran between the forks of the Edisto from Orangeburg Bridge to the Indian Head, before continuing to the Ridge (near modern-day Ridge Spring). A SW branch led to Augusta, while NW branches led to Long Cane Creek and Ninety Six. INDIAN HEAD (Reverse) The Indian Head, a series of springs at the head of Goodland Swamp, long served as a landmark and watering place. Travelers along the Middle Road referenced it and it appears on colonial plats. In 1781 Loyalists under command of Lt. Col. John H. Cruger passed near here after their withdrawal from Ninety Six. They were pursued by Whigs, including militia commanded by Col. Andrew Pickens. Sponsored by the Aiken County Historical Society, 2016

After the Civil War Hamburg became a center of African American political power in Aiken County. In 1868 three members of the Providence Congregation, John Gardner, Prince Rivers, and Samuel Lee, won election to the S.C. legislature. All three would rise to greater political prominence during the era of Reconstruction. (Reverse) In 1929 a massive flood inundated Hamburg and forced residents to move to higher ground. The town never recovered. Many residents salvaged material to rebuild their homes. Providence Baptist Church was similarly dismantled and rebuilt atop the 75 foot bluff behind the old town.

(Front) In 1941 a group including Pete Bostwick, Mrs. Ambrose Clark, and Skiddy von Stade Sr. organized to build the Aiken Training Track (ATT) on 75 acres that included parts of the Post and Mead polo fields. Frank Phelps designed the one mile oval track, which was modeled after Keeneland Race Track in Lexington, KY. The purpose of constructing the ATT was to have a facility for the training of Thoroughbred race horses. (Reverse) A unique feature of the ATT is its “Horine” turns (flattened curves). The new design gave a longer straightaway and allowed for easier turns at high speed. The Aiken Trials, which are still held here, began in 1943 as an impromptu event to benefit the American Red Cross War Fund. Six Kentucky Derby, three Belmont Stakes, and nine Preakness winners have trained here. Sponsored by the Aiken County Historical Society, 2016

Portions of the house date to as early as 1837. The south wing was built c.1852 as a detached workshop for James Legare, who was also an inventor and painter. The north wing was added c.1900, after the workshop was moved and attached to the house. (Reverse) While living here, James Legare published his best-known work, Orta-Undis, and other Poems (1848). He also produced several inventions, including a cotton-based plastic he called “lignine.” In 1870, the Legare family sold the property to Thomas Charles Morgan (1824-1905), an English naval officer. His son, attorney Thomas Redman Morgan (1863-1931), was Aiken mayor from 1899 to 1900 and lived in the house for a number of years. Sponsored by Aiken County Historical Society, 2019

(Front) The turn-of-the-century barn to the south is a notable example of eclectic Victorian, brick, U-shaped barn design and construction. It has a rare working early 20th century carriage lift. In 1909, David W. Gaston, Sr. (1860-1931) acquired the barn and surrounding farmland from the local Steadman family and opened a livery business here with his son, David W. Gaston, Jr. (1880-1932). (Reverse) Gaston’s livery provided important transportation and recreation services to local residents and members of Aiken’s “Winter Colony.” The business rented and boarded horses for use around town and performaned maintenance on horse-drawn vehicles. It closed in 1932. The barn continued to be used as part of a working farm for several more decades.

2-66 AIKEN’S JEWISH MERCHANTS 
118 LAURENS ST. SW, AIKEN 
(Front) Sustained Jewish settlement in Aiken dates to the 1890s. By 1920, a concetration of Jewish-owned businesses had opened along this section of Laurens Street and other streets nearby. The first known Jewish merchant in Aiken was Harris L. Polier, a Russian immigrant who opened a department store south of here in 1888. Other prominent merchant families later in this area included the Suraskys, Poliakoffs, Wolfs, Efrons, and Rudnicks. (Reverse) As Aiken’s Jewish population grew with the rest of the city, merchants and their families played important roles in their community and in broader civic life. Several helped found Aiken’s first Jewish cemetery (1913) and incorporate its first Jewish congregation (1921). By the 1950s, Aiken had more than twenty Jewish-owned businesses. This site (116-120 Laurens St.) was the location of three stores owned by the Surasky family. Sponsored by Aiken County Historical Society, 2021

(Front) This cemetery dates to the 1820s and was in use prior to the founding of the Town of Aiken (1835). It was established by the local Williams family, who were among Aiken’s earliest settlers and used this as their burial ground for several generations. The cemetery was originally part of a plantation anchored by a main house 2/10 mi. NW. Twenty members of the Williams family are known to be buried here in graves dating from 1824 to 1922. (Reverse) Among those interred here is family patriarch William White Williams (1787-1845), a state representative who in the early 1830s deeded land for the construction of the S.C. Railroad, which spurred Aiken’s creation. A member of the Burckhalter family is also buried here. The cemetery is also said to contain the unmarked grave of a solider buried here by the Williams family after being fatally wounded during a nearby skirmish between Confederate and Union troops in Feb. 1865.

(Front) This white frame building, first known as “Edgewood,” was an excellent example of Federal-era architecture. Originally near Edgefield, it was built c.1836 for Francis W. Pickens (c.1805-1869), state representative and senator, congressman, and governor. In 1928, the then-neglected home was acquired by Eulalie Chafee Salley (1883-1975), a noted local realtor, business woman, and women’s rights advocate. (Reverse) Salley hired architect Willis Irvin and contractor Byron Hair to dismantle and move the home to the Kalmia Hill section of Aiken, where it was remodeled. Salley lived there until her death. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Developer Ronald Bolton donated it in 1989 to the Univ. of S.C. Aiken. The house was relocated, renovated for university use, and reopened in 1992. Sponsored by University of South Carolina Aiken and Aiken County Historical Society, 2021

CHAIN GANGS (Front) In 1894 the S.C. legislature passed an act requiring all male prisoners sentenced to less than two years to serve their term performing hard labor on public roads. The law promised to improve rural S.C. roads, but many of those sentenced to hard labor had committed petty crimes and most were African American. A 1920 report found that the Allendale chain gang suffered poor and unsanitary conditions. Some inmates at the Allendale Jail served on road gangs well into the 20th century. ALLENDALE CO. JAIL (Reverse) In 1919 the S.C. General Assembly issued $100,000 in bonds to fund construction of a jail and courthouse in the newly established Allendale County.

Capers was born in Charleston in 1788 and became a minister with the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1809. He likely stayed on the Gillett’s land for only a brief time, but may have helped to spread the seed of Methodism here. (Reverse) Early meetings were held under a brush arbor. Elijah Gillett, at the urging of his wife Elizabeth Scarbrough Gillett, donated land and lumber to erect a permanent meeting house, which they deeded to the Methodist Church. The Gilletts are buried 3 ½ miles N. of the church. The meeting house was remodeled in 1910, but retains original floors, wainscoting, and pulpit. Sponsored by the Gillette Church Family, 2018

(Front) This church first organized c.1815, when members met in a log house 2 mi. S that was adjacent to a sheet of water known as “Swallow Savannah,” the church’s namesake. Local preacher John McFail was likely instrumental in the church’s organization. Through the 1800s, members used several sites along Old Augusta Road including a church built on land given by Dr. Cornelius Ayer and dedicated in 1848. The church cemetery remains there. (Reverse) The church was part of the Black Swamp Circuit until 1855, when the Allendale Circuit was formed. In 1880, members made plans to move to Allendale, then a growing railroad depot town. A white clapboard church was built at this site after Lawrence Williams donated the land in 1890. That building burned in 1942 and was replaced by the current church, which was dedicated in 1946.

The church was adjacent to a sheet of water known by the late 1700s as “Swallow Savannah,” supposedly for the many swallows that gathered there. Members began worshipping at this site by 1848, when a church was dedicated on land donated by Dr. Cornelius Ayer. (Reverse) The church moved to the town of Allendale c.1890 but continued to use this cemetery for burials. Upon the election of a cemetery committee in 1894, a survey was completed that formalized burial plots. In 1898, a chapel was built at the cemetery using materials from the old church building. The cemetery has been expanded over the years and includes church members and non-members alike. Sponsored by Swallow Savannah Cemetery Committee, 2019

At that time several free blacks and slaves who were members of Barnwell Baptist Church asked to use the old 1829 sanctuary for worship and meetings. The congregation agreed, and the group met here informally until 1868. (Reverse) In 1868 seven black members of Barnwell Baptist Church asked the congregation for letters of dismissal, which were granted so that they could formally organize Bethlehem Baptist Church. The old Barnwell Baptist Church sanctuary served Bethlehem Baptist Church until it was demolished in 1898. Some material was salvaged to build the present sanctuary, which was renovated in 1981.

DUBOIS PARK, W. SIDE OF BOUNDARY ST., BLUFFTON 
(Front) Bluffton, an antebellum planters’ summer village, was virtually abandoned by its seasonal and year-round inhabitants when Federal forces captured Beaufort and Port Royal in November 1861. Confederate forces used it as an outpost to watch Port Royal Sound and the Charleston & Savannah RR. Early on June 4, 1863, an expedition of some 1,000 Federals landed at Hunting Island Plantation, then marched to Bluffton. (Reverse) Confederate pickets raised the alarm but could not offer immediate resistance and the Federals surprised a small Confederate force camped on the May River. A brief skirmish ended when shells from a Federal gunboat drove the Confederates away. Federal infantry then burned some 40 houses and other outbuildings, about two-thirds of the village.

7-51 BLUFFTON 
100 FT. W OF SW CORNER OF MAY RIVER RD. AND CALHOUN ST. INTERSECTION, BLUFFTON 
(Front) Originally known as May River, and later as Kirk’s Bluff, Bluffton was settled as a resort town where planters could escape the hot, malarial summers of lowcountry plantations. The streets were laid out in the 1830s and much of the early development took place along Calhoun and Bridge Streets. Bluffton’s commerce was largely a result of the river trade, and a steamboat landing completed by the early 1850s served to increase traffic and spur growth. (Reverse) During the Civil War, Union forces set fire to much of the town during a raid and short battle on June 4, 1863. After the war, Bluffton emerged as a local commercial center with a number of general stores operating in the town. New transportation networks diverted traffic away from the river by the mid-20th century and trade declined. The rise in tourism since the 1990s has served as a catalyst for Bluffton’s reemergence as a resort destination.

7-52 BEREAN CHURCH/J.I. WASHINGTON BRANCH LIBRARY 
602 CARTERET ST., BEAUFORT 
BEREAN CHURCH (Front) Berean Presbyterian Church was founded by Samuel J. Bampfield, an influential African American political figure during Reconstruction. Bampfield served in the S.C. House of Representatives, was Beaufort’s postmaster, and clerk of the county court. In 1892 the congregation purchased this lot and constructed a church in the Gothic Revival style. Solomon P. Hood, who later was appointed U.S. Minister to Liberia, was the first pastor. J.I. WASHINGTON BRANCH LIBRARY (Reverse) In 1931 the building was purchased by the Beaufort Township Library and converted for use as a segregated branch library for African Americans. It operated in that capacity until 1965 when this branch closed and Township Library was desegregated. The building was later used as headquarters for the Neighborhood Youth Corps and in 1993 was purchased by USC Beaufort for use as an art studio.

7-53 INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY 
FREEPORT MARINA, 1 FREEPORT RD., DAUFUSKIE ISLAND 
(Front) Archeological evidence suggests human activity on Daufuskie Island as early as 12,000 B.C., with seasonal habitation tied to the harvesting of coastal resources. Early European inhabitants also realized the importance of the coastal waterways for navigation and transportation, utilizing the tidal waters as an intracoastal highway between Charleston and Savannah. (Reverse) Later improvements would formalize and extend this inland water route, and this section of the Cooper River is a small portion of what is now the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), a 3,000 mile long inland shipping channel that stretches along the East and Gulf Coasts. The Atlantic portion of the ICW extends from Norfolk to Key West, traveling past Daufuskie Island on its journey south. Sponsored by S.C. Society Colonial Dames XVII Century, Donald S.

7-54 FORT MITCHEL 
65 SKULL CREEK DRIVE, HILTON HEAD 
(Front) Fort Mitchel was built by the U.S. Army in 1862. It was an earthen fortification of lunette design, open at the rear with two faces forming a salient angle and two flanking sides. It was designed to house five or six heavy guns and was positioned strategically to control Skull Creek and protect the approach to the U.S. Navy coaling station at Seabrook Landing, one mile NE of this spot. (Reverse) Originally named for its designer, Capt. Quincy Gillmore, Ft. Mitchel was renamed in honor of Maj. Gen. Ormsby Mitchel in 1863. Mitchel briefly commanded Union forces on Hilton Head before he died of yellow fever in Oct. 1862. The introduction of ironclad ships later in the war made the small battery at Ft. Mitchel ineffective and the garrison was redeployed in 1864. Sponsored by Beaufort County Historical Society, 2015

7-55 QUEEN CHAPEL A.M.E. CHURCH 
114 BEACH CITY RD., HILTON HEAD 
(Front) The congregation of Queen Chapel can trace its roots to May 1865 when A.M.E. missionaries Rev. R.H. Cain, Rev. James H.A. Johnson, and James A. Handy arrived on Hilton Head Island. They visited the Freedmen’s town of Mitchelville and preached a sermon before departing for Charleston. Missionaries like Cain, Johnson, and Handy represented the first official A.M.E. presence in S.C. since 1822. (Reverse) In 1865 Charleston born A.M.E. Bishop D.A. Payne returned to S.C. and brought with him a group of missionaries. When they arrived in Hilton Head they met with Rev. James Lynch, who had come to S.C. in 1863 to perform missionary work among the Freedmen. The A.M.E. denomination experienced rapid growth after the Civil War and Queen Chapel was among the early churches founded. Sponsored by Beaufort County Historical Society and Queen Chapel A.M.E.

(Front) European occupation of Parris Island dates to the French Charlesfort, 1562-1563. The Spanish built Santa Elena 1566-1587 which was capital of Spanish Florida from 1571-1576. William III of England granted the island to Robert Daniel in 1698 and Col. Alexander Parris, the island’s namesake, bought it in 1715. Union forces captured Port Royal Sound in 1861 and Parris Island served as a Quartermaster coaling station for the duration of the Civil War. (Reverse) Port Royal Naval Station opened in 1889. The base became dedicated to use by the Marine Corps in 1915. Parris Island served as the principal training facility for Marine Corps recruits during WWI. After WWII, the Depot has served as the exclusive training site for enlisted women Marines. The base has played a pivotal role in regional development, both through improved infrastructure and direct and indirect economic benefits. Sponsored by the Beaufort County Historical Society, 2016

7-57 CYRUS GARVIN/CYRUS GARVIN HOUSE 
BLUFFTON OYSTER FACTORY PARK, WHARF ST. NEAR INTERSECTION WITH BRIDGE ST., BLUFFTON 
CYRUS GARVIN (Front) Little is known of Cyrus Garvin’s early life. He was likely born into slavery, possibly on a plantation of the Baynard family. Garvin is notable for having amassed considerable status and property after emancipation. In 1868 he was acting as an agent on Ephraim Baynard’s Montpelier plantation. By 1870 he was farming 75 acres and that number had risen to 100 ten years later. In 1878 he acted as an agent for St. Matthews Baptist Church, helping them to acquire land in Bluffton. CYRUS GARVIN HOUSE (Reverse) Cyrus Garvin built the house located here c. 1870 and it is believed to be the oldest extant dwelling built by Freedpeople in Bluffton. The extended hall-and-parlor design was a vernacular form common to the low country. By 1880 Garvin lived here with his wife Ellen, their son Isaac, and Isaac’s wife Janie and son Paul. Janie, who died in 1954, was the last person to inhabit the house, though the Garvins remained owners until 1961. The Beaufort Co. Land Trust acquired the land in 2001.

7-58 BAPTIST CHURCH OF BEAUFORT 
600 CHARLES ST., BEAUFORT 
(Front) The Baptist Church of Beaufort descends from Euhaw Baptist Church on Edisto Island. In 1794 the first meeting house was built on this site. In 1795 Henry Holcombe moved to Beaufort and became the first mission pastor. The Beaufort Baptist Church was formally constituted as an independent church in 1804. The first burial was in 1809. Prior to the Civil War, 3,557 of 3,723 members were enslaved people. (Reverse) The current Greek Revival building dates to 1844 and was constructed under the pastorate of Richard Fuller, who served 1833-1847. During the Civil War the church was a Union Army hospital for black troops. In Dec. 1862, Rev. Solomon Peck read the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation from the pulpit to an audience of escaped slaves and black soldiers. After the war, nearly all black members left to join newly formed black churches. Sponsored by the Beaufort County Historical Society, 2018

7-59 LADY’S ISLAND OYSTER FACTORY 
106 SUNSET BLVD, BEAUFORT 
(Front) The eastern oyster launched the Beaufort Co. commercial seafood industry. The first canning factory on this site, for which Factory Creek was named, was begun in 1883. Oysters were harvested from Sept. to May. Tomatoes and okra were canned in the summer. After the hurricane of 1893 the oyster industry became the largest employer in the county, providing jobs to approximately 3,500 Sea Islanders. (Reverse) By 1929, this factory was the largest producer of cove oysters in the world. L.P. Maggione bought the factory in 1917. In the 1950s it had over 300 employees, canning oyster products, tomatoes, and okra. African American migration to northern states in the early-to-mid 20th century, accompanied by die off in oyster beds, led to decline of the industry and the work force shrank to 25. The factory closed in 1986. Sponsored by the Beaufort County Historical Society, 2018

LEAMINGTON LN., HILTON HEAD ISLAND 
(Front) The Rear Lighthouse of the Hilton Head Range Light Station was built in 1879-1880 by the U.S. Light House Board. Its light, which stood 92-feet above sea level, was visible from 15 miles away and once served to guide shipping vessels in Port Royal Sound. This tower was once part of a complex that also included a keeper’s house and forward beacon, which was located more than 1 mile in front of this position. (Reverse) Sailors entering Port Royal Sound would steer their ships until the lights from the rear tower and forward beacon aligned. The frequently shifting channel required the forward beacon to be relocated numerous times. In 1884 a movable keeper’s house with an integrated beacon was built to accommodate the frequent moves. Decommissioned in 1932, the lighthouse is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Sponsored by the Leamington POA, 2018

(Front) Following Emancipation, education was a priority for African American families on Daufuskie. Adults and children attended school at First Union African Baptist Church 1872-1934. Church families purchased land in 1930 and by 1933 had raised funds to build a school. Workers from the island built the school. The two-room Mary Field School opened in 1934 with grades 1-6. (Reverse) Mary Field became a Beaufort Co. school in the 1950s. Miss Frances Jones taught on the island 1930-1969 and educated several generations of Daufuskie families. Author Pat Conroy was briefly a teacher here 1969-70 and his novel The Water is Wide was based on his experience. In 2009 the former school building was renovated to be used for church functions and as a community center. Sponsored by Daufuskie Island Historical Foundation, 2018

(Front) Beaufort College, a college preparatory academy founded in 1795, occupied this Greek Revival building from 1852 to 1861. The School opened in 1804 on Bay Street, but closed in 1817 after a yellow fever epidemic, reopening in 1820 at Newcastle and Craven Sts. This building designed by John Gibbs Barnwell II featured two classrooms, two offices, and a library modeled after the one at S.C. College, now the South Caroliniana Library at the University of S. Carolina. (Reverse) Beaufort College closed in the fall of 1861 when U.S. troops occupied the city. Its library was sent north and stored at the Smithsonian Institution but the books burned. During the Civil War it was a school for former slaves and a hospital for Federal troops. The college trustees regained control after the war. It was a private school for whites until it became a public elementary school in 1909. It became the Beaufort campus of the University of S.C. in 1959.

1 LAURENS ST., BEAUFORT 
(Front) This house was commissioned by Edgar Fripp (1806-1860) and completed c.1853. Based upon architect Samuel Sloan’s designs, it was built in the Italianate style, with a prominent central cupola, and served as the “town home” for Fripp and his wife Eliza (1810-1861). Fripp was a substantial Sea Island Cotton planter, who owned Seaside Plantation on St. Helena Island. During the Civil War the house served as U.S. Hospital #7, which provided care for officers. (Reverse) The house suffered severe damage from the Sea Isand Hurricane of 1893. The cupola and gables were then incorporated into the roof, and a second floor piazza typical of the “Beaufort Style” was added. In the 1920s it was named “Tidalholm,” meaning home by the river, and served as a popular seasonal guest house and retreat. In the late 20th century it was the backdrop for several Hollywood films including “The Great Santini” (1979) and “The Big Chill” (1983). Sponsored by Historic Beaufort Foundation, 2019

Organized by whites, the church’s 216 members in 1861 included 181 African Americans, who were likely enslaved to its white congregants. The church caught fire during the Civil War but survived. By 1874, local freed people began worshipping here as an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church eventually known as Campbel Chapel. (Reverse) Campbell Chapel was part of a wave of Reconstruction-era AME churches organized to serve southern African Americans’ spiritual and educational needs. In 1875, it was one of two churches in the AME Bluffton Mission, which had 190 members. Since altered several times, the building was first purchased by nine founding trustees for $500.

(Front) In Oct. 1943, the U.S. Army opened a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp near here on Pigeon Point Road. It was one of more than twenty POW camps built in S.C. during World War II to hold Axis prisoners. Around 250 Italian soldiers arrived here from Camp Wheeler near Macon, Ga., after being captured in North Africa. They were housed in tents and were among the more than 425,000 Axis POWs held in the U.S. during the war. (Reverse) The Italian soldiers here were employed by Beaufort Co. truck farmers to harvest vegetables, making up for labor shortages that arose as farm workers fought overseas or found better-paying jobs related to the war effort. The camp here opened one month after Italy surrendered to Allied forces. It closed by spring 1944. Axis POWs remained in other camps around S.C. until 1946, when the last prisoners left U.S. soil.

Founded by inventor Sterling Harris, the company worked with food scientist Dr. Carl Fellers to patent a process that eliminated the blue coloration of canned Atlantic blue crab meat without altering its flavor. The company kept principal offices in Beaufort and briefly operated on Lady’s Island before moving here to Port Royal and expanding. (Reverse) For years, Blue Channel was the nation’s top producer of Atlantic blue crab and one of the largest crab packing firms in the country. The crabs processed here were caught and picked primarily by African American men and women of the local Gullah community, who had long crabbed and fished along the Sea Islands. Blue Channel moved its canning operations to the Beaufort Industrial Park in 1978 and closed in 1990.

It was built at the urging of the Clover Club, a local women’s literary group who in 1902 began a small subscription library. The Beaufort Library Society formed in 1802, however Union soldiers confiscated its collection in 1862, leaving Beaufort with no permanent library until this facility opened as the Beaufort Township Library on March 25, 1918. (Reverse) The library was built on a lot donated by the Town of Beaufort. Many of its first books were provided by the Clover Club. The library was designed by architect James Hagood Sams of Columbia and built by contractor J.H. Moore of Camden. In 1962, the Beaufort Township Library became a countywide library system following an act of the S.C. General Assembly.

S.C. HWY. 45, 10 MILES WEST OF ST. STEPHEN FRANCIS MARION 
(Front) Brigadier General of S.C. Militia during the American Revolution, Francis Marion, was one of the partisan leaders who kept the war alive during the British occupation of the state. His elusive disappearances after surprise attacks against superior forces harassed and demoralized the enemy, earning for him the name, "Swamp Fox." FRANCIS MARION’S GRAVE (Reverse) Francis Marion died Feb. 27, 1795, in his 63rd year, and was buried here at Belle Isle Plantation, home of his brother, Gabriel. His own plantation, Pond Bluff, was about 15 miles up river and is now under Lake Marion. He was born in South Carolina, the descendant of French Huguenot emigrants. The exact date and place of his birth are unknown. Erected by South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism, 1975, replacing a marker erected by the S.C.

OLD MT. HOLLY RD. & U.S. HWY. 52, GOOSE CREEK 
(Front) Medway, established in 1686, features a 1704-05 brick house which is one of the oldest in S.C. The Lords Proprietors gave 12,000 acres on Back River to Johan W. van Aerssen (1632-ca. 1687), a Dutch Huguenot. In 1688 van Aerssen’s widow Sabina married Thomas Smith (ca. 1648-1694), who acquired the plantation in 1691 and built a one-story brick house here ca. 1692. Smith, who was later briefly governor of S.C. 1693-94, is buried at Medway. (Reverse) Edward Hyrne acquired Medway from Thomas Smith’s son, but the house burned in 1704. Hyrne built a new brick house in the same style. Later owners added a second story and other additions from the 1820s to the 1870s. The Stoney family owned Medway from 1833 to 1930, when Sidney (1903-1948) and Gertrude Legendre (1902-2000) bought it. The Legendres restored the house and grounds, and Medway was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Erected by the City of Goose Creek, 2009, replacing a marker erected in 1965

ST. JAMES, GOOSE CREEK CHAPEL OF EASE (Front) One of two chapels of ease for St. James, Goose Creek Parish stood here on the road to Moncks Corner, about 7 miles from the 1719 parish church. The chapel of ease was a brick building with a cruciform plan. It was completed by 1725, during the tenure of the Rev. Richard Ludlam, but was already in ruins by 1820. BETHLEHEM BAPTIST CHURCH (Reverse) Bethlehem Baptist Church, founded in 1812, built a frame church on this site. Described as “a neat wooden church adjoining the ruin” just before the Civil War, it was moved 4.5 miles NW in 1880. The church was renamed Groomsville Baptist Church for the Groom family, which donated the land. Cemeteries laid out here by the Anglicans and Baptists are contiguous and intermingled.

AT THE ENTRANCE TO MOUNT HOLLY ALUMINUM, 3575 ST. JAMES AVE. (U.S. HWY. 52), GOOSE CREEK 
THOROGOOD PLANTATION (Front) In 1682 the Lords Proprietors granted 3,000 acres here, on a branch of the Back River, to Joseph Thorogood (d. 1684). Though Thorogood only owned the plantation two years and his widow Jane sold it after his death, it was called “Thorogood” for most of the 19th century. By the 1720s Andrew Allen owned Thorogood, established a profitable rice plantation here, and was also engaged in the local fur trade. MOUNT HOLLY PLANTATION (Reverse) Thorogood passed to John Deas (d. 1788) and his son John, Jr. (1761-1790). It, Mount Holly, and Cyprus plantations remained in the Deas family until 1824. Subdivided after the Civil War, this area was the core of an African American farming community. H. Smith Richardson bought it as a hunting plantation in 1937, renaming it Mount Holly. Mt.

8-50 GOOSE CREEK/CITY OF GOOSE CREEK 
125 ST. JAMES AVE., GOOSE CREEK 
GOOSE CREEK (Front) This area has been called Goose Creek since the late 17th century. For almost 200 years after the Lords Proprietors granted large tracts to English, French Huguenot, and other planters, their plantations dominated the landscape. After the Civil War most plantations were subdivided into small farms, many of them owned by freedmen and their descendants. Rural farming communities grew up around area crossroads from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. CITY OF GOOSE CREEK (Reverse) World War II and the Cold War brought dramatic growth to this area with the U.S. Ammunition Depot and Naval Weapons Annex in 1941 and 1959, respectively. The population grew so quickly that local leaders hoping to manage the influx chartered and incorporated the City of Goose Creek in 1961, with Hilton W. Bunch as its first mayor. In 1966 a building here, originally a laundry, was converted for use as the third Goose Creek City Hall, serving the town from 1974 to 1999. Erected by Advance Auto Parts, Inc., 2007

RUSSELLVILLE RD./OLD MILL RD., ST. STEPHEN 
ST. STEPHEN COLORED SCHOOL (Front) St. Stephen Colored School, the first public African American school in St. Stephen, was built here in 1924-25. A three-room frame building, it was one of almost 500 schools in S.C. funded in part by the Julius Rosenwald Foundation 1917-1932. It opened with grades 1-7, but burned in 1935. A brick elementary and high school with grades 1-10 replaced it. Grades 11 and 12 were added in 1936-37 and 1948-49. ST. STEPHEN HIGH SCHOOL (Reverse) A nine-room brick high school was constructed here in 1944-45, with Woodrow Z. Wilson as its last principal. It closed in 1954, and its students transferred to the new Russellville High School. The elementary school, with grades 1-7, was replaced by a new St. Stephen Elementary in 1966. The buildings here were torn down in 1965, and their bricks and lumber donated to Allen A.M.E. Church. Erected by the Alumni and Friends of St. Stephen Colored Elementary and High School, 2008

MATILDA CIR. (S.C. SEC. RD. 204), JUST SOUTH OF ITS JUNCTION WITH S.C. HWY. 45, PINEVILLE 
(Front) Pineville, established in 1793-94, was one of the first planters’ retreats in the South. James Sinkler built the first summer house here in 1793. Pineville, named for its “religiously preserved” pines and known for its “sweet and balmy air,” became a village in 1794 after John Cordes, Peter Gaillard, John Palmer, and Peter, Philip, and Samuel Porcher built houses here as well. (Reverse) By 1830 Pineville had more than 60 houses, a chapel, an academy, a library, and a race track. Frederick Porcher wrote in 1858, “the prestige of its ancient fame remains.” Union troops burned most of the village in 1865, except the chapel, library, post office, and Gourdin House (ca. 1820).

OLD MT. HOLLY RD., JUST SOUTH OF ITS INTERSECTION WITH U.S. HWY. 52, MOUNT HOLLY 
MOUNT HOLLY STATION (Front) Mount Holly Station, a depot on the Northeastern Railroad between Florence and Charleston, was built here about 1853. It was named for nearby Mount Holly Plantation, carved out of Thorogood Plantation shortly before the American Revolution by John Deas, Jr. (1761-1790), a planter and state representative. The railroad tracks crossed the main oak avenue to the plantation, just south of the station and platform. MOUNT HOLLY (Reverse) Otranto (or Porcher) was the next station toward Charleston, 19 mi. SSE. After the Civil War this vicinity, which kept the name Mount Holly, was a predominantly white rural community, in contrast to black rural communities nearby at Casey, Howe Hall, and Liberty Hall. Rice plantations were replaced by subsistence farms worked by families, tenants, or sharecroppers. Mount Holly was incorporated into the City of Goose Creek when it was created in 1961.

(Front) The Oaks, an inland rice plantation, was established here by Edward Middleton (d. 1685) on a 1678 grant from the Lords Proprietors. Middleton, a planter who came to S.C. from Barbados, received 1,630 acres on Yeaman’s Creek, later renamed Goose Creek. Middleton served in several colonial offices, including as a member of the Grand Council. The Oaks passed to Middleton’s son Arthur (1681-1737), also on the Council, later President of the first Royal Council. (Reverse) Arthur Middleton’s son Henry (1717-1784) served in the Continental Congress 1774-75 and was briefly its President. He later served in the Provincial Congress and first General Assembly of S.C. The original house here burned in 1840, long after the Middletons sold the property. The present house was built 1892 for Maine businessman Edwin Parsons, and renovated in 1930 by New York banker Charles Sabin. It has been The Oaks Plantation Golf & Country Club since 1964.

(Front) Broom Hall Plantation, later called Bloom Hall and still later Bloomfield, was first granted to Edward Middleton in 1678. By 1710 this property passed to Benjamin Gibbes (d. 1722), who named it for Broom House, his ancestral home in England. Gibbes’s widow Amarinthia later married Peter Taylor (d. 1765), a longtime member of the Royal Assembly and rice planter, who built a large two-story brick house here. (Reverse) Broom Hall passed to Thomas Smith (1720-1790), member of the Royal Assembly and the Provincial Congress. An 1828 visitor called its gardens “the most interesting spot I have seen in Carolina.” Sold to Henry Arthur Middleton in 1856, the house was virtually destroyed by the Charleston earthquake of 1886. Later owned by Westvaco, Broom Hall was subdivided for residential development in 1980. Erected by the City of Goose Creek, 2008

8-56 CROWFIELD PLANTATION 
CROWFIELD GOLF & COUNTRY CLUB, 300 HAMLET CIR., GOOSE CREEK 
(Front) Crowfield Plantation, on the headwaters of Goose Creek, was originally granted to John Berringer in 1701. John Gibbes (1696-1764), a member of the Royal Assembly, sold it in 1721 to Arthur Middleton (1681-1737), also a member of the Royal Assembly. Middleton’s son William (1710-1785) built a large two-story brick house here ca. 1730, naming it for Crowfield Hall, his great-aunt’s English manor. (Reverse) William Middleton grew rice and indigo, raised cattle, made bricks, and laid out an elaborate formal garden. Rawlins Lowndes (1721-1800) bought Crowfield during the American Revolution; he sold it in 1783, describing it as “that elegant most admired seat.” The house was virtually destroyed by the Charleston earthquake of 1886. Later owned by Westvaco, Crowfield became part of the Crowfield Golf & Country Club in 1990. Erected by the City of Goose Creek, 2008

8-57 EARLY INDIAN TRADING PATHS/THE GOOSE CREEK MEN 
GOOSE CREEK MUNICIPAL CENTER, 519 N. GOOSE CREEK BLVD., GOOSE CREEK EARLY INDIAN TRADING PATHS (Front) One of the earliest major trading paths in the Carolina colony, dating from the first decade of English settlement 1670-1680, ran nearby. The colonists traded guns and ammunition, cloth, rum, and other goods for furs and skins, trading with the Catawbas, Coosas, Westos, and Yamasees in the lowcountry and the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws farther in the backcountry. 
THE GOOSE CREEK MEN (Reverse) The “Goose Creek Men” were English planters, some who came to S.C. from Barbados. They settled nearby, soon became wealthy through the Indian trade, and conducted an illegal trade in Indian slaves and with pirates. The Goose Creek Men formed a faction opposing the Lords Proprietors between 1670 and 1720. Two of them, James Moore, Sr. (d. 1706) and his son James Moore, Jr. (d. 1724) served as governor of the colony. Erected by the City of Goose Creek, 2008

8-58 BOWEN’S CORNER 
INTERSECTION OF FOSTER CREEK RD.. & TANNER FORD BLVD., HANAHAN 
(Front) Bowen’s Corner, an African-American farming community from the mid-19th century through the late-20th century, was originally part of a rice plantation established along Goose Creek in 1680. That tract was granted by the Lords Proprietors to Barnard Schenckingh (d. 1692). It was later owned by Benjamin Coachman (d. 1779), member of the Royal Assembly. By 1785 it passed to John Bowen (d. 1811), a state representative, for whom Bowen’s Corner is named. (Reverse) Bowen and later absentee owners through the antebellum and post-Civil War era often employed slaves and freedmen as overseers or managers, giving them an opportunity to work toward self-sufficiency. “Bowen’s Old Place” was subdivided into small farms after the war. By 1936 the Bowen’s Corner community, between the railroad and the Goose Creek Reservoir, was centered on Bethel A.M.E. Church and Bowen’s Corner School, for grades 1-8, which closed in 1954.

(Front) The first bridge here, in use by 1680, had a raised road at either end and was built from split logs with the flat sides up, covered by sand or clay. Traffic over Goose Creek increased significantly after St. James, Goose Creek Church was built 200 yds. S in 1714-19. By the 1750s the bridge had to be replaced every few years. In 1780 British troops occupying The Oaks Plantation nearby guarded the bridge, a strategic point on the road to and from Charleston. (Reverse) The bridge was torn down and replaced by a larger covered one shortly after the Revolution. A later covered bridge, built in 1851, was 200 ft. long, on brick piers, with a plank floor and cypress shingle roof. It was burned in 1865 by Confederates attempting to delay Federals in the area. Another bridge here, built some years after the Civil War, was uncovered, with a simple railing. By 1925 a new U.S. Highway 52 included a bridge upstream and W. of this crossing.

(Front) Spring Grove, an inland rice plantation on the Back River, was part of a 1706 grant by the Lords Proprietors to John Barnwell. By 1727 the tract passed to planter and state representative Joseph Wragg (d. 1751) as part of his Dockton plantation. Spring Grove was not a separate plantation until 1793, when it included 1,406 acres, owned by planter and state representative George Keckley (d. 1829). (Reverse) Spring Grove remained in the Keckley family until 1843, when it was purchased by William Bell, who owned Cypress Grove and Pine Grove plantations nearby. Bell’s son sold it soon after the Civil War. Spring Grove was later owned by the E.P. Burton Lumber Co., then the Cooper River Mining & Manufacture Co., and later the Pine Grove Hunting Club.

(Front) In April 1715 Yamasee warriors killed government agents and traders who had come to meet with them at Pocotaligo, in present-day Beaufort County. Others killed colonists and raided plantations and farms at Port Royal, initiating the Yamasee War. Catawbas and Cherokees soon launched raids on other white towns and settlements, and many whites in Goose Creek fled to Charleston or barracaded themselves in their houses. (Reverse) Capt. Thomas Barker, who lived 1.5 mi. N, left Goose Creek on May 15 with 102 militia, intending to meet the Congarees near the Santee River. He and 26 men were killed in an ambush on May 16. On June 13 Capt. George Chicken and 120 cavalrymen of the Goose Creek militia ambushed a war party 20 mi. W near Wassamassaw, killing 40-60 and scattering the rest.

AT THE INTERSECTION OF STATE RD. (U.S. HWY. 176) AND JEDBURG RD., JEDBURG VICINITY 
(Front) Wassamassaw, with several variant spellings during the colonial era, is a Native American word thought to mean “connecting water.” It first referred to the large cypress swamp here, but eventually referred to the community that grew up nearby in the Anglican parish of St. James, Goose Creek. Plantations laid out by the English and later by the Huguenots flourished before the Revolution. (Reverse) The swamp was almost impassible for most of the colonial period, but the Wassamassaw Road ran just below the swamp between here and Goose Creek. A Chapel of Ease was built nearby shortly after the Yamasee War of 1715, and a free school was founded in 1728. The “Wassamassaw Cavalry,” a militia company founded in 1857, later saw Confederate service as Company D, 2nd S.C. Cavalry. Erected by Berkeley County, 2009

112-114 WESTOVER DR., GOOSE CREEK 
FRENCH HUGUENOT PLANTATION (Front) Abraham Fleury, sometimes called Abraham Fleury Sieur De La Plaine, settled here about 1680. He was one of the first French Huguenot planters in Carolina. The Huguenots, Protestants who escaped the persecution of Catholic France, immigrated with encouragement from the Lords Proprietors, who promised them opportunity and religious freedom. They later assimilated into the predominantly Anglican society of the lowcountry. FREEDMEN’S PLANTATION (Reverse) This tract was often called Cherry Hill after it was merged into that plantation before the Revolution. In 1858 freedman and planter Lamb Stevens (1766?-1868) added it to his extensive holdings. Stevens, born into slavery in N.C., later purchased his freedom and moved to S.C. He owned as many as 30 slaves, some of them relatives he bought in order to protect them and their families. Lamb died in 1868 at the age of 102. Erected by the City of Goose Creek, 2010

William Johnson (d. 1818), later a planter and state representative, bought it in 1769. Johnson demolished Vanderdussen’s ruined house and built a new one, which he named “White House,” on the old foundation. He grew rice and indigo here for many years. (Reverse) Johnson, an ardent Patriot, served in the Provincial Congress and the S.C. House of Representatives during the Revolution. He was an artilleryman during the Siege of Charleston in 1780, was held prisoner in exile for more than a year, then was reelected to the S.C. House several times after the war. White House eventually fell into ruins, and in 1941 the U.S. Navy acquired this property for its Naval Weapons Station. Erected by the City of Goose Creek, 2010

In 1757 the original grant, with an additional 1,000 acres that had been owned by the Wilson and Godin families, was acquired by rice planter and legislator Peter Manigault (1731-1773). Manigault named his plantation for a stream that ran through his rice fields down to Goose Creek. (Reverse) Peter Manigault’s two-story house sat on a nearby ridge on the bank of Goose Creek. Manigault, longtime member of the Commons House of Assembly, was Speaker of the House 1765-1772 and at his death the wealthiest man in North America. His son Gabriel (1758-1809), a planter and legislator, was best known as an amateur architect. W.J.

FAIRLAWN PLANTATION (Front) Fairlawn Barony, sometimes called “Fair-Lawn,” was granted to Peter Colleton, whose father John had been one of the original Lords Proprietors of the Carolina colony. John’s grandson John (1679-1754), known as “The Honorable,” was a planter and member of the Grand Council and the first Colleton to live in S.C. He built a large brick house here, later described by his granddaughter as “of course very magnificent.” FORT FAIRLAWN (Reverse) In April 1780, after their victory at Moncks Corner, British and Loyalist troops occupied Fairlawn and built an earthwork fort 1/2 mi. E. On November 17, 1781, Patriot militia under Cols. Hezekiah Maham and Isaac Shelby, on orders from Gen. Francis Marion, attacked the outpost commanded by Capt. Neal McLean. They took about 150 prisoners. The house, used as a hospital and storehouse, was burned. Contemporary accounts, however, disagree on which force burned it.

NEAR INTERSECTION OF 1ST AVENUE AND N MAIN ST., GOOSE CREEK VICINITY 
(Front) Carnes Crossroads was part of a 3,000 acre royal grant to Joseph Thorowgood in 1682. Later, the Etiwan, Native Americans who had lived on Daniel Island, moved here after European settlement pushed them from the Ashley-Cooper drainage basin. The Etiwan, part of the Cusabo group, had fewer members and were less powerful than the Westo and Cherokee to the west. They formed strategic alliances with British colonists and sided with the Carolina colony in the Yemassee War. (Reverse) By the early 20th century Dallas Carn, for whom the intersection is named, had acquired substantial land surrounding the crossroads. Carn had a homestead, farm, and business interests that he operated near this spot. As automobile traffic grew by mid-century, Carnes Crossroads remained a hub for rural commerce. Smith’s Store, located just south of here, sold fuel and dry goods to locals and also operated as a dance hall that catered to military personnel stationed nearby.

(Front) From the 18th century, the State Road from Charleston and the Road to Dorchester met near here. These paths connected Charleston to the S.C. interior. Travelers from Charleston would have crossed Goose Creek, two miles south, before reaching this point. By the early 18th century a tavern complex developed here providing travelers with room, board, pasturage, and other services, such as coopering and blacksmithing. (Reverse) By the turn of the 19th century, Lewis Breaker owned the business. Later, Carston Vose, who also owned the Oaks Plantation, ran the tavern. In April 1865 African American troops of the 55th MA Infantry camped near here. They skirmished with Confederate cavalry and liberated slaves living on nearby plantations. After the war the Road to Dorchester was abandoned and a farm family occupied the site. Sponsored by the City of Goose Creek, 2016

The first parish church was built in 1708 on a bluff overlooking the Stono River. The parsonage and outbuildings were destroyed during the Yamasee War of 1715. After St. John’s Colleton Parish was created in 1734, a new parish church for St. Paul’s was built 8 mi. NW in 1736. ST. PAUL’S CHURCHYARD (Reverse) Foundation ruins and a few graves are all that remain of the first St. Paul’s, Stono. Robert Seabrook (1652-1710), buried here, served as high sheriff of Colleton County in 1698; as a captain of militia in 1706; and as a member of the Commons House of Assembly 1706-09, serving as Speaker in 1706. His wife Sarah (d. 1715) and their son Benjamin (d. 1717) are also buried here. Erected by the Charles Towne Chapter, Colonial Dames of the XVII Century, 2002

10-37 LAING SCHOOL 
KING ST. AND ROYALL AVE., MT. PLEASANT 
(Front) Laing School, located here from 1868 to 1953, was founded in 1866 by Cornelia Hancock, a Quaker who had served as a nurse with the Union Army during the Civil War. First housed in Mount Pleasant Presbyterian Church, Laing Industrial School was named for Henry M. Laing of the Friends’ Association for the Aid and Elevation of Freedmen. The 1868 school, destroyed by the Charleston earthquake of 1886, was replaced by a school which stood here until 1954. (Reverse) Early instruction at Laing, with its motto, “Try To Excel,” combined academics with instruction in industrial, farming, and homemaking skills. A new Laing Elementary opened at King & Greenwich Streets in 1945; the high school remained here until a new Laing High opened on U.S. Hwy. 17 North in 1953. Laing High closed in 1970 with the desegregation of county schools. That building later housed Laing Middle School when it opened in 1974. Erected by the Laing School Alumni Association, 2002

10-38 FRIENDSHIP A.M.E. CHURCH 
204 ROYALL AVE., MT. PLEASANT 
(Front) This church, founded during Reconstruction, has been at this site since 1890. The first sanctuary serving this congregation was located on Hibben St. and built on a lot leased from the town of Mount Pleasant in 1877. After moving here and building a new church under the pastorate of Rev. F.E. Rivers in 1890, the congregation grew so quickly that it built its third sanctuary, a large frame church, by 1895. (Reverse) A 1911 storm during the pastorate of Rev. Frank Woodbury nearly destroyed the sanctuary, which was essentially rebuilt. Later renovations, including the application of a brick veneer in 1961 during the pastorate of Rev. J.A. Sabb, Jr., gave the church its present appearance. Friendship A.M.E. Church also hosted the graduation exercises of nearby Laing School for many years until the school closed in 1953. Erected by the Congregation, 2001

HAMPTON PLANTATION STATE PARK, 1950 RUTLEDGE RD., AT ITS INTERSECTION WITH U.S. HWY. 17, MCCLELLANVILLE 
(Front) Hampton Plantation, 2 mi. NW, was established by 1730 and was one of the earliest rice plantations on the Santee River, in an area settled by Huguenots and often called "French Santee." The house, built in the 1730s for Elias Horry, later passed to his granddaughter Harriott Horry, who married Frederick Rutledge in 1797. The plantation remained in the Rutledge family until 1971. (Reverse) One of Hampton's best-known owners was Archibald Rutledge (1882-1973), educator, man of letters, and first poet laureate of S.C. He wrote of life there in Home By The River (1941), calling it "the mother plantation of this old plantation country." Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970, it has been Hampton Plantation State Park since the state acquired it in 1971. Erected by the St. James-Santee Parish Historical Society, 2001

? Marker erroneously numbered 10-4. It should read 10-43. 
54 HASELL ST., CHARLESTON 
(Front) This house, built ca. 1712, is believed to be one of the oldest houses in Charleston. It was built for William Rhett (1666-1723), a merchant, sea captain, militia officer, and speaker of the Commons House of Assembly famous for capturing the pirate Steed Bonnet. In 1807 Christopher Fitzsimons (d. 1825), a merchant and planter, bought the house, renovating and enlarging it and adding its piazzas. (Reverse) The asymmetrical plan of the house includes a central hall with two large rooms on the western side and two slightly smaller rooms on the eastern side. With the relative decline of “Rhettsbury” in the early 20th century the house was a boarding house during the 1920s and 30s. Its restoration by Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin R. Kittredge, Jr., who bought it in 1941, was one of the first in this part of Charleston. Erected by the Historic Charleston Foundation, 2002

THE PARSONAGE (Front) “The Parsonage,” the home of Rev. James B. Middleton (1839-1918), stood here at 5 Short Court (now President’s Place) until 1916. Middleton and his siblings, born slaves, were taught to read and write by their father, Rev. James C. Middleton (1790-1889). After the Civil War the elder Middleton, his son Rev. Abram Middleton (1827-1901), and Rev. James B. Middleton organized and served as pastors of many Methodist churches in the lowcountry. MISS IZARD’S SCHOOL (Reverse) This house, the home of the Frazer and Izard families, was built at 7 Short Court (now President’s Place) by 1872. Anna Eliza Izard (1850-1945), niece of Revs. James B. and Abram Middleton, was a graduate of the Avery Normal Institute and taught school here for many years. Mamie Garvin Fields (1888-1987), a Middleton descendant, described life at 5 & 7 Short Court in Lemon Swamp and Other Places (1983).

JUNCTION OF POE AVE. AND PALMETTO ST., ADJACENT TO BATTERY JASPER AT FORT MOULTRIE NATIONAL MONUMENT, SULLIVAN’S ISLAND 
(Front) On June 28, 1776, a British and Loyalist force seeking to capture Charleston advanced to Sullivan's Island with 9 ships and 2,500-3,000 infantry. The American defenders, 435 men under Col. William Moultrie of the 2nd S.C. Regiment, occupied a fort nearby, built from palmetto logs. Still unfinished when the fighting began, it is sometimes referred to as "Fort Sullivan" in contemporary accounts. (Reverse) As Adm. Peter Parker's ships shelled the fort its log walls absorbed or deflected the British shells and the Americans lost only 37 men killed or wounded. Moultrie's shells damaged every ship, inflicted 219 losses, and forced Parker's withdrawal. A British land attack at Breach Inlet also failed. The first major Patriot victory of the war also gave S.C. its nickname, "The Palmetto State." Erected by the Fort Sullivan Chapter, National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, 2005

(Front) The Stono Rebellion, the largest slave insurrection in British North America, began nearby on September 9, 1739. About 20 Africans raided a store near Wallace Creek, a branch of the Stono River. Taking guns and other weapons, they killed two shopkeepers. The rebels marched south toward promised freedom in Spanish Florida, waving flags, beating drums, and shouting “Liberty!” (Reverse) The rebels were joined by 40 to 60 more during their 15-mile march. They killed at least 20 whites, but spared others. The rebellion ended late that afternoon when the militia caught the rebels, killing at least 34 of them. Most who escaped were captured and executed; any forced to join the rebels were released. The S.C. assembly soon enacted a harsh slave code, in force until 1865.

In 1704 Ralph Izard (d. 1711), member of the Commons House of Assembly, bought a 250-acre tract here, expanding it to more than 500 acres. His son Ralph II (d. 1743) also served in the Assembly and on the Royal Council. The first to plant rice at The Elms, he enlarged it to more than 2,700 acres. (Reverse) Ralph Izard III (1742-1804) lent money to the Patriot cause and later served in the Continental Congress. A state representative after the war, then U.S. Senator, Izard was briefly President Pro Tempore of the Senate. An 1818 visitor to The Elms described its “avenue of lofty elms & of loftier live oaks.” Its ca. 1718 house, later rebuilt after a fire, was virtually destroyed by the Charleston earthquake of 1886.

FOLLY BEACH COMMUNITY CTR., 55 CENTER ST., FOLLY BEACH 
CAMP OF WILD’S “AFRICAN BRIGADE,” 1863-1864 (Front) Folly Island was occupied by Union troops April 1863-February 1865. Gen. Edward A. Wild’s “African Brigade” camped nearby from November 1863 to February 1864. The two regiments in Wild’s brigade were the 55th Massachusetts, made up largely of free blacks, and the 1st North Carolina, made up of former slaves. WILD’S BRIGADE CEMETERY (Reverse) A cemetery was laid out nearby for soldiers in Wild’s Brigade who died here in 1863-64. Most graves were removed after the war. In 1987 relic hunters discovered additional graves of U.S. Colored Troops. In 1987-88 archaeologists removed 19 burials and published their findings. These soldiers were reburied with full military honors at Beaufort National Cemetery in May 1989. Erected by The Friends of the 55th Massachusetts, 2010

KING ST., AT THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF MARION SQUARE NEAR HUTSON ST., CHARLESTON 
(Front) The British capture of Charleston in May 1780 was one of the worst American defeats of the Revolution. On March 30-31 Gen. Henry Clinton’s British, Hessian, and Loyalist force crossed the Ashley River north of Charleston. On April 1 Clinton advanced against the American lines near this site, held by Gen. Benjamin Lincoln’s Continentals and militia. The 42-day siege would be the longest of the war. (Reverse) As Gen. Charles Cornwallis closed off Lincoln’s escape routes on the Cooper River, Clinton advanced his siege lines and bombarded Charleston. On May 12, 1780, in front of the American works near this spot, Lincoln surrendered the city and his force of 6,000 men, after what one British officer called “a gallant defense.” The British occupied Charleston for more than 2 1/2 years, evacuating Dec. 14, 1782.

10-66 CALVARY EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
104-106 LINE STREET, CHARLESTON
(Front) This church, located on Beaufain Street for 91 years, was organized in 1847 to give free blacks and slaves in antebellum Charleston a separate Episcopal congregation of their own. The Rev. Paul Trapier was its first minister, and the church met in the St. Philip’s Episcopal Church parsonage, then in Temperance Hall, before acquiring a lot at the corner of Beaufain and Wilson Streets. (Reverse) A stuccoed brick church on Beaufain Street was completed and consecrated in 1849. In 1940 Charleston Housing Authority bought the historic church and lot to build the Robert Mills Manor housing project. The congregation bought this lot on Line Street from the city and dedicated this sanctuary in 1942. Three African-American cemeteries have been on this site: one “Colored,” one Baptist, and Calvary Episcopal. Erected by the Congregation, 2010

It succeeded the Charleston Normal & Industrial School, a private school at Bogard & Kracke Streets, which had been founded in 1894 by Rev. John L. Dart. The new Charleston Colored & Industrial School, built here at President and Fishburne Streets by the City of Charleston, opened in January 1911 with 375 students. (Reverse) David Hill became the first African-American principal in 1919. The school was renamed Burke Industrial School in 1921 in memory of J.E. Burke, vice chairman of the public school board. By 1930 Burke, with 1,000 students, had a full elementary and high school curriculum in addition to its vocational curriculum. Burke merged with Avery High School in 1954, was accredited, and was renamed Burke High School, in a new complex on this site. It was rebuilt in 2005.

CANNON STREET HOSPITAL (Front) Cannon Street Hospital, established here in 1897, served the African-American community of Charleston until 1959. Officially the Hospital and Training School for Nurses, it occupied a three-story brick building constructed ca. 1800. Dr. Alonzo C. McClennan (1855-1912), then one of only six black physicians in Charleston, was one of its founders and also edited The Hospital Herald 1898-1900. MCCLENNAN-BANKS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (Reverse) By 1956 Dr. Thomas C. McFall, director of the Cannon Street Hospital, led a campaign to build a new hospital. McClennan-Banks Memorial Hospital, which opened on Courtenay Street in 1959, was named for Dr. McClennan and Anna DeCosta Banks (1869-1930), first head nurse of the Cannon Street Hospital. The old hospital here was torn down in 1961; the new hospital closed at the end of 1976 and was torn down in 2004.

134 MEETING STREET, CHARLESTON
INSTITUTE HALL (Front) Institute Hall, built here in 1854, stood until 1861. An Italianate building, it was designed by Jones and Lee for the South Carolina Institute, a progressive organization promoting “art, ingenuity, mechanical skill, and industry.” The Grand Hall, Charleston’s largest public space, seated 3,000 and hosted fairs, exhibits, concerts, balls, and conventions. It hosted the 1860 Democratic convention, which split over the mention of slavery in the platform. “THE UNION IS DISSOLVED!” (Reverse) Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in Nov. 1860 was the catalyst for a secession convention in S.C. The convention met in Columbia on Dec. 17, but moved to Charleston the next day. On Dec. 20, 1860, S.C. became the first state to secede from the Union. That night delegates signed the Ordinance of Secession before a huge crowd in the Grand Hall. Institute Hall later burned in the “Great Fire” of Dec. 1861.

46 REID ST., CHARLESTON 
(Front) A cemetery established here in 1841, also known as “God’s Acre” and later “the German Cemetery,” was maintained by St. Matthews Evangelical Lutheran Church until about 1860. That church, founded in 1840 by the rapidly-growing community of Germans in Charleston, was originally the German Evangelical Church of Charleston. Its founders purchased land here for a cemetery shortly before they built their church at the corner of Anson and Hasell Streets. (Reverse) Hampstead Cemetery, laid out between cemeteries owned by the African Society and the Hebrew Congregation, sold half-plots and quarter-plots to church members and others. Yellow fever epidemics in 1849, 1852, and 1856 killed so many Germans that the cemetery was almost full by 1857, when the church dedicated Bethany Cemetery, a new cemetery in North Charleston, near Magnolia Cemetery. Several graves found herre in 1982 were removed to Bethany in 2009. Erected by the Housing Authority of the City of Charleston, 2011

(Front) Hampton Park Terrace, an early 20th-century planned suburb, was laid out in 1912 along Huger Street between Rutledge and Hagood Aves. Its success coincided with the economic boom that following the opening of the Charleston Navy Yard in 1901. It was also aided by its location immediately south of Hampton Park, a large municipal park built on the site of the 1901-02 Charleston and West-Indian Exposition. (Reverse) Developers praised “the open fresh beauty of Hampton Park Terrace” and called it “the ideal home overlooking both river and Park.” Most houses dates from 1912 to 1922 and include excellent examples of the American Foursquare, Colonial Revival, Prairie, Craftsman, and Bungalow styles.

(Front) This church, built in 1797 in the meeting-house form, was dedicated in 1798 and completed in 1809. It is the oldest Methodist church standing in Charleston. Originally at the corner of Pitt and Calhoun Streets, Bethel Methodist Church was a congregation of white and black members, both free blacks and slaves. Many blacks left the church in 1833 during a dispute over seating. Though some later returned, many did not. (Reverse) In 1852 the congregation moved this building west to face Calhoun Street, to make room for a new brick church, completed the next year. This church, called “Old Bethel,” was used for Sunday school before its black members acquired it in 1876. They kept the name Old Bethel and moved the church to this location in 1882. Old Bethel Methodist Church was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Erected by the Congregation, 2011

(Front) Plainsfield Plantation, on this site, and Pawletts Plantation, nearby, were established ca. 1690 by Joseph Blake (1663-1700), one of Carolina’s Lords Proprietors and governor of the colony 1694 and 1696-1700. Blake, who had come to the colony ca. 1685 and was soon a member of the Grand Council, named his plantations for locales in his native Somersetshire, England. (Reverse) Blake was governor when he purchased Sir John Berkeley’s proprietary share in 1694. Blake, a Dissenter who supported religious liberty and citizenship for French Huguenots and other non-English settlers, died in office. The “Goose Creek Men,” planters who opposed his and the Proprietors’ policies on settlers and Indian trade, took control of the government after Blake’s death.

PALMETTO COMMERCE PARKWAY, NORTHWEST OF ASHLEY PHOSPHATE RD., NORTH CHARLESON VICINITY 
Embankments and ditches dating from the early 18th century are still visible here and show the elaborate layout of rice fields that were part of Windsor Hill and Woodlands plantations. Before the American Revolution, lowcountry planters grew rice in inland fields that did not use the tides for flood waters. Windsor Hill was established ca. 1701 by Joseph Child (d. 1717), and Woodlands was established ca. 1800 by Thomas Parker (d. 1821). The remnants of these rice fields are a tangible reminder of the skill and labor of the enslaved people who constructed them, many of whom had been rice farmers in Africa.

(Front) Early on May 13, 1862, Robert Smalls, an enslaved harbor pilot aboard the Planter, seized the 149-ft. Confederate transport from a wharf just east of here. He and six enslaved crewmen took the vessel before dawn, when its captain, pilot, and engineer were ashore. Smalls guided the ship through the channel, past Fort Sumter, and out to sea, delivering it to the Federal fleet which was blockading the harbor. (Reverse) Northern and Southern newspapers called this feat “bold” and “daring.” Smalls and his crew, a crewman on another ship, and eight other enslaved persons including Smalls’s wife, Hannah, and three children, won their freedom by it. Smalls (1839-1915) was appointed captain of the U.S.S. Planter by a U.S. Army contract in 1863. A native of Beaufort, he was later a state legislator and then a five-term U.S. Congressman.

701 E. BAY ST., CHARLESTON 
CIGAR FACTORY (Front) This five-story commercial building, built ca. 1882 as a textile mill, was known as the Charleston Manufacturing Company, then Charleston Cotton Mills, in its early years. Leased to the American Tobacco Company in 1903, the plant was sold to that company in 1912. Popularly called “the Cigar Factory,” it produced cigars such as Cremo and Roi-Tan until it closed in 1973. The Cigar Factory was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. 
“WE SHALL OVERCOME” (Reverse) By the end of World War II the factory employed 1,400 workers, 900 of them black women. In October 1945, 1,200 workers walked out over discrimination and low wages. Strikers sang the gospel hymn “I’ll Overcome Someday.” Later revised as “We Shall Overcome,” it would become the anthem of the Civil Rights Movement. The strike ended in March 1946 with a settlement giving workers raises and promising better treatment.

JAMES SIMONS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (Front) This school, built in 1919 and designed by local architects Benson & Barbot, was the fifth public elementary school in the city. It opened for the 1919-1920 school year with an enrollment of 600. In 1955 the Charleston Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) petitioned the Charleston school board to desegregate all public city schools, including this one. DESEGREGATION OF CHARLESTON SCHOOLS (Reverse) In 1960 nine parents, with support from the NAACP, applied for their children’s transfer to four white schools, including James Simons Elementary School.

Kress, with about 400 American stores, designed its own buildings. This store features a yellow brick façade with colorful and decorative glazed terracotta details typical of Kress’s Art Deco designs. A 1941 two-story addition faces Wentworth Street. McCrory Stores bought this building in 1980, operating it under the Kress name until 1992. CIVIL RIGHTS SIT-INS (Reverse) On April 1, 1960, the lunch counter here and those at the Woolworth’s and W.T.

CHARLES TOWNE LANDING STATE HISTORIC SITE, CHARLESTON 
CHARLES TOWNE (Front) The first permanent English settlement in what is now S.C. was established here in 1670. Named for King Charles II, the town was built on Albemarle Point, on the W bank of the Ashley River. It began in 1670-71 with a palisaded fort and a few houses. As it grew, additional lots were laid out across the Ashley River on Oyster Point. In 1680 the proprietors of the colony moved the capital to that site, in present-day downtown Charleston. OLD TOWN PLANTATION (Reverse) By 1700 this site was known as “Old Town Plantation,” and it was used for farming for almost 300 years. The last owners, Dr. and Mrs. Joseph I. Waring, renovated the overseer’s house as their home and created 80 acres of landscaped gardens. In 1969 they sold more than 650 acres to the state of S.C., which developed a park here for the S.C.

U.S. COURTHOUSE AND POST OFFICE (Front) This Renaissance Revival building, opened in 1896, is notable for its association with U.S. District Judge J. Waties Waring (1880-1968). Waring, a Charleston native who served here 1942 to 1952, issued some of the most important civil rights rulings of the era. Briggs v. Elliott, the first suit to challenge public school segregation in the U.S., was heard here before three judges on May 28-29, 1951. BRIGGS V. ELLIOTT (Reverse) Thurgood Marshall and other NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyers represented Harry and Eliza Briggs and 19 other courageous parents from Clarendon County. In a bold and vigorous dissent opposing the prevailing doctrine of separate but equal, Waring declared that segregation “must go and must go now.

PLYMOUTH CHURCH (Front) In 1867 over 100 African Americans, most former members of the Circular Church, founded Plymouth Church, among the oldest black Congregational Churches in the South. Plymouth is an example of the independent black churches formed at the dawn of emancipation. Early pastor Francis L. Cardozo was also involved in the operation of Avery Normal Institute, a school for black students. This Gothic Revival church building was completed in 1872. PLYMOUTH PARSONAGE (Reverse) Plymouth parsonage, built in 1886, was home to church leaders. Pastors who lived here were active in anti-lynching and equal rights campaigns. Plymouth also hosted a number of prominent black figures. W.E.B. Du Bois, a founding NAACP member, visited in 1925, and Paul Robeson, a singer and activist, stayed here while campaigning for presidential candidate Henry Wallace in 1948.

HARMON FIELD (Front) Harmon Field, established in 1927, was one of many parks across the country created with support from the Harmon Foundation, a national philanthropic organization. Though dedicated to the “Recreation of All,” state law mandated the racial segregation of public parks and Harmon Field remained a facility for African Americans until it was desegregated in 1964. Among other uses, the park was a venue for games played by amateur and semi-pro baseball teams. CANNON STREET ALL-STARS (Reverse) In 1953 the Cannon St. YMCA established the first African American Little League in S.C. and played games at Harmon Field. In 1955 the Cannon St. YMCA entered a team in the state Little League tournament. Rather than integrate, white teams boycotted and the Cannon St. All-Stars were state champions by forfeit.

(Front) The first confirmed cultivation of tea in the U.S. occurred when French botanist André Michaux brought to plants to Middleton Barony on the Ashley River between 1799-1802. Large-scale production, however, was not attempted. Beginning in 1880 the U.S. Congress subsidized renewed cultivation efforts. The Pinehurst Plantation in Summerville was the most successful of these attempts. (Reverse) In 1963, cuttings from Pinehurst Plantation were transferred to 127 acres on Wadmalaw Island; land that is now the Charleston Tea Plantation. Because the Pinehurst plants had grown wild and cross-pollinated for decades prior to transfer they are now considered “South Carolina hybrids.” Charleston Tea Plantation remains the only site of large-scale commercial tea production in the U.S. Sponsored by Fort Sullivan Chapter, National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, 2014

Among them were Sarah (1792-1873) and Angelina (1805-1879) Grimké who became leading advocates for equal rights for African Americans and women. (Reverse) From 1836-1838 the sisters, the first female agents of the abolitionist movement, traveled the Northeast as lecturers and organizers. In 1837 they helped organize the first national convention of white and black women. Also in 1837 Sarah published a full-fledged argument for women’s equal rights. The next year Angelina became the first American woman to address a legislative body, speaking to a committee of the Mass. legislature. Neither sister ever returned to Charleston.

RIVERLAND DR. APPROXIMATELY ½ MILE WEST OF INTERSECTION WITH GRIMBALL ROAD, JAMES ISLAND 
(Front) The Civil Air Patrol (C.A.P.) was formed in 1941, just prior to U.S. entrance into WWII. C.A.P. air bases were located from Maine to Mexico and the James Island base was the 8th constructed. Its 3 runways were carved from a 108-acre cotton field and operations began in May 1942. This base remained in service until C.A.P. operations were moved to Charleston AFB after the war. (Reverse) From May 1942 to August 1943 almost 100 volunteers at Base 8 flew daily patrol missions. Aircrews primarily hunted enemy submarines, protected shipping lanes, and performed search and rescue. South Carolina natives Drew L. King and Clarence L. Rawls died at sea when their plane crashed off Myrtle Beach on Feb. 9, 1943. Sponsored by S.C. Wing – Civil Air Patrol, 2016

10-91 SLAVE AUCTIONS 
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF EAST BAY ST. AND GILLON ST. INTERSECTION, CHARLESTON 
(Front) Charleston was one of the largest slave trading cities in the U.S. In the 1800s, the area around the Old Exchange Building was one of the most common sites of downtown slave auctions. Along with real estate and other personal property, thousands of enslaved people were sold here as early as the 1770s. Most auctions occurred just north of the Exchange, though some also took place inside. Merchants also sold slaves at nearby stores on Broad, Chalmers, State, and East Bay streets. (Reverse) Enslaved Africans were usually sold at wharves along the city harbor. Some Africans were sold near the Exchange, but most people sold here were born in the U.S., making this a key site in the domestic slave trade. In 1856, the city banned auctions of slaves and other goods from the Exchange. Indoor sales grew elsewhere, and Ryan’s Mart, a complex of buildings between Queen and Chalmers streets, became the main downtown auction site.

10-92 FIREPROOF BUILDING 
100 MEETING ST., CHARLESTON 
(Front) Constructed 1822-26, the County Records Building, known as the Fireproof Building, was designed by Charleston-born architect Robert Mills. Mills eliminated combustible materials from the design. Stone steps, flagstone flooring, and brownstone sills were used in place of wood. The brick vaulting on the interior carried the weight of the upper floors and eliminated the need for joists. The roof was clad in copper and all window sashes and frames were iron. (Reverse) Massive brownstone columns with roughcast stucco adorn the matching porticos on the north and south elevations. These porticos place this building within the Greek Revival style and it was the first public building in the city designed in that form. Home to the S.C. Historical Society since 1943, the Fireproof Building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973.

HARBOR VIEW RD. AT NORTH SHORE DR., JAMES ISLAND 
(Front) The Battle of Dills Bluff, the last engagement in S.C. during the American Revolution, took place on Nov. 14, 1782. Continental Army forces under command of Col. Thaddeus Kosciusko, and led by Capt. William Wilmot’s 2nd Maryland and Lt. John Markland’s 1st Pennsylvania Regiments, attacked a force of British infantry and cavalry on the south side of James Island Creek. (Reverse) The British regulars were prepared for the attack, possibly through advance intelligence, and able to rush reinforcements to the field. The Continentals were outnumbered five to one and quickly overwhelmed. Markland was wounded; Wilmot and Lt. Moore of the Maryland line were killed. A slave named William Smith was wounded and taken prisoner. The British would evacuate Charleston in Dec. 1782. Sponsored by Town of James Island, 2016

MARION SQUARE, CHARLESTON 
(Front) In 1823, after learning of London’s success with artesian wells, City Council agreed that deep artesian wells would be feasible for the city and its growing population. Several pilot projects followed and in 1879 a 1,970-feet deep well was drilled near this site. With an impressive 700,000 gallons per day yield, it is reported to be the first successful artesian supply in the region. (Reverse) The artesian supply was Charleston’s primary water source until 1903 when a franchise was granted to the Charleston Light and Water Co. to take over the city system and construct a new plant and reservoir by damming Goose Creek. In 1917, the city acquired the plant and properties, forming the Commissioners of Public Works, now Charleston Water System, to manage and operate the city water system.

Pleasant to graduate African American students from the 12th grade, was dedicated at this site in the Six Mile Community. From its inception, Laing students have made significant contributions to the state, nation, and world. (Reverse) Laing H.S. closed in 1970 when Charleston Co. schools desegregated.

(Front) Simeon Pinckney, who was born a slave in Manning, S.C., enlisted in the 3rd S.C. Inf. (Colored) in 1863, and also served in the 21st U.S. Colored Infantry during the Civil War. Later, Pinckney settled on James Island with wife Isabella, stepson Daniel, and sons Alex and Samuel. In 1874 he purchased twenty acres of land for $350. Here he built a house and farmed the land on his own account. (Reverse) Simeon Pinckney died in Nov. 1921 and is buried in the Fort Johnson area. Remarkably, Pinckney was not only able to purchase land during Reconstruction, but the family was also able to retain ownership of at least a portion of the tract for nearly 150 years. The Town of James Island purchased 7 acres of the Pinckney homestead for use as a public park in 2016. Sponsored by Town of James Island, 2017

She was born at 105 Wentworth St. on May 3, 1898 to Peter Poinsette, a former slave, and Victoria Anderson, who was of Haitian descent. Clark earned her teacher’s certificate from Charleston’s Avery Normal Institute and her master’s from Hampton Institute. She taught for nearly 40 years. (Reverse) In 1953, Clark visited the Highlander Folk School in TN, which was dedicated to training community organizers and pursuing equality for all. Here she developed the “citizenship school” model, which promoted literacy and political education. By 1965 Clark had helped to organize nearly 900 citizenship schools, including the first one on nearby Johns Island, and had helped to register more than 50,000 Black voters.

(Front) Dart Hall, at Kracke and Bogard Sts., was founded in 1927 by Susan Dart Butler (1888-1959) as the first public library for African Americans in Charleston. She was the daughter of Rev. John L. Dart (1844-1947), who in 1894 established the Charleston Normal and Industrial Institute, later Burke H.S. The library began as a reading room in the printing office of the Institute, relying on Rev. Dart’s personal collection. (Reverse) In 1931, with support of the Julius Rosenwald Fund, the collection and building expanded, and Dart Hall became a branch of the Charleston Free Library. The Dart family leased the building to the county for $1 a year until the county bought the building in 1952. Susan Dart Butler continued to serve as librarian until 1957. In 1968 a new library was completed here and the original Dart Hall Library was razed. Sponsored by the Charleston County Public Library, 2017

HAMPTON PARK, CHARLESTON 
(Front) Hampton Park was once home to the Washington Race Course and Jockey Club. In 1864 this site became an outdoor prison for Union soldiers. Before Charleston fell in Feb. 1865, more than 250 prisoners died and were buried in mass graves. After Confederate evacuation, black ministers and northern missionaries led an effort to reinter bodies and build a fence around a newly established cemetery. Over the entrance workmen inscribed the words “Martyrs of the Racecourse.” (Reverse) On May 1, 1865 a parade to honor the Union war dead took place here. The event marked the earliest celebration of what became known as “Memorial Day.” The crowd numbered in the thousands, with African American school children from newly formed Freedmen’s Schools leading the parade. They were followed by church leaders, Freedpeople, Unionists, and members of the 54th Mass., 34th, and 104th U.S. Colored Infantries. The dead were later reinterred in Beaufort.

10-100 CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1868 
MEETING ST., BETWEEN BROAD AND TRADD ST., CHARLESTON 
(Front) In January 1868 delegates met to rewrite the S.C. Constitution. They convened at the Charleston Club House, which once stood near here. Before the Civil War the Club House was reserved for Charleston’s planter elite, but a majority of the delegates in 1868 were African American, some of them former slaves. The election of delegates to the convention was the first time that African American men voted in S.C. (Reverse) The 1868 Constitution was a remarkable document for its time. The Declaration of Rights made no distinctions based on race. It created the basis for the state’s first public school system, as proposed by Robert Smalls, and guaranteed black male suffrage two years ahead of the 15th Amendment. In 1895, a new constitution would mandate segregated schools, outlaw interracial marriages, and disenfranchise black men. Sponsored by the S.C. Civil War Sesquicentennial Advisory Board, 2018

CENTER ST. AND WEST ASHLEY AVE., FOLLY BEACH 
(Front) In the 1930s author DuBose Heyward and his wife, playwright Dorothy Heyward, owned a cottage 7 blocks W of this location. During the summer of 1934 American composer and pianist George Gershwin stayed at Folly Beach and collaborated with the Heywards on his folk opera Porgy and Bess (1935), which was based upon DuBose Heyward’s 1925 novel Porgy. The house where Gershwin stayed was destroyed by a hurricane, but the Heyward home remains and is known locally as the “Porgy House.” (Reverse) Both Heyward’s novel and Gershwin’s opera were rare for their time as examples of white writers treating African American subjects as complex figures. During his stay in the Lowcountry Gershwin visited Black churches on James Island and incorporated some of what he saw and heard into his musical production. Porgy and Bess opened on Broadway in 1935 and ran for 124 performances. Today, the opera is perhaps best remembered for the song “Summertime.” Sponsored by the Folly Beach Exchange Club and the City of Folly Beach, 2018

(Front) The Town of Lincolnville was founded in 1867 by seven African American leaders: Daniel Adger, Marc Buffett, Rev. Richard H. Cain, Hector Grant, Rev. Lewis Ruffin Nichols, Rev. M.B. Salters, and Walter Steele. The town was located along the S.C.R.R. and was originally known as Pump Pond because the steam engines would stop here to refill their tanks. It was renamed Lincolnville in honor of Abraham Lincoln. The town was formally incorporated in 1889. (Reverse) Lincolnville was established as an African American enclave. Rev. R.H. Cain purchased 500 acres, divided it into town lots, and sold to black settlers. By 1884 there were approximately 120 families living here and the town government was composed entirely of African American men. In addition to founding the town, Cain also served in the S.C. Senate and the U.S. House (1873-5, 1877-9). He was the first pastor of Emanuel A.M.E. Church after the Civil War and was appointed bishop in 1880. Sponsored by the Town of Lincolnville, 2018

CAROLINA ART ASSOCIATION (Front) In 1857, a group of civic-minded Charlestonians established the Carolina Art Association. The goal of the CAA was to promote fine arts in S.C. The CAA was awarded its official state charter in 1858. The CAA is today the oldest surviving arts association in the Southeast. Upon his death in 1888, patron of the arts James S. Gibbes left a bequest that allowed the city and the CAA to build a museum of fine art. JAMES S. GIBBES MEMORIAL ART GALLERY (Reverse) Designed by Frank Milburn, the James S. Gibbes Memorial Art Gallery, now the Gibbes Museum of Art, opened in 1905. The Beaux Arts-style building is the oldest purpose-built museum in S.C. and the oldest permanent structure designed for the display of art in the South.

(Front) The Pinckney Mansion was a Colonial double house built c.1746 at this site, then a large waterfront lot known as Colleton Square. It is believed to have been designed by owner Charles Pinckney (c.1699-1758), a planter and Chief Justice of Provincial S.C. His wife Eliza Lucas (1722-1793) lived here after helping found colonial S.C.’s indigo industry. Enslaved people and free workers, skilled and unskilled, built the house. Colonial governors leased the property 1753-69. (Reverse) Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (1746-1825), a framer of the U.S. Constitution, was among the mansion’s residents. The house was one of the first in the U.S. with a Classical temple front façade. Among the first Palladian villas in Charleston, it helped set a new trend of planters keeping their main dwelling in town instead of at the plantation. Also at the site was a graden and a long row of outbuildings, including slave quarters and stables. Pinckneys owned the house until it burned in 1861.

MEMMINGER HOUSE (Front) Christopher Memminger (1803-1888) lived in a home at this site as early as 1830. A German immigrant orphaned at age 4, Memminger was adopted by future S.C. Governor Thomas Bennett. Memminger served in the S.C. legislature and championed public education before and after the Civil War. He helped draft the Confederate Constitution and was the Confederacy’s Secretary of the Treasury 1861-1864. He returned to Charleston after the war and lived here until his death. MCALISTER FUNERAL HOME (Reverse) John McAlister was one of the city’s first licensed embalmers and began an undertaking business on Meeting St. in the 1880s. In 1960, McAlister Funeral Home moved to this location and replaced the Memminger House with a purpose-built funeral home designed by Charleston architect Augustus Constantine (1898-1976).

Plans to locate a federal building here began as early as 1939, but World War II delayed the effort into the 1950s. It was the first major federal building project completed in postwar S.C. Designed by Charlestonian John Califf of Lyles, Bissett, Carlisle, and Woolfe, the seven-story Modernist building both praise and criticism upon its completion. (Reverse) In 1972, Congress officially renamed the building for Lucius Mendel Rivers (1905-1970). A Berkeley County native and 29-year U.S. Congressman, Rivers secured valuable military projects for the Charleston area and helped ensure the building’s completion, later keeping an office here. Federal agencies and legislators occupied the building until 1999, after which it was threatened with demolition. It remained vacant until being reopened as a hotel in 2016.

National Guard, the unit kept an enlistment of 30-40 men tasked with helping preserve civil order. Most of them were farmers or laborers. The unit was disbanded in 1891 after trying to stop the arrest of a Black man in Charleston but was reinstated in 1892. (Reverse) In 1899, Hunter’s Volunteers bought this site from Sarah Grimball and Henry Grimball. Over time, the unit became more of a mutual aid society and social club than a military outfit. In 1897, a year after being disarmed by the state, members chartered the Hunter Volunteer Charitable Society.

The beach began as a gathering spot for workers at a nearby oyster factory in the 1920s and 1930s. A store selling seafood and drinks first opened in the 1930s. Other businesses followed in the 1940s and 1950s. (Reverse) Mosquito Beach lies along a tidal marsh historically known for the large mosquito population that gave the beach its name. By the 1960s, the beach provided African American leisure-seekers with music venues, pavilions, restaurants, and a hotel.

In 1967, ACL merged with Seaboard Air Line to become the Seaboard Coast Line, which later merged with CSX. In 1970, Congress passed an act to prevent the financial collapse of several U.S. railroads by creating Amtrak, a national railroad corporation. (Reverse) Charleston Station was a two-story building designed in the International style and was emblematic of mid-century modern architecture. It was long and linear, with a low-sloped roof. The most distinctive feature was the green Mo-Sai pre-cast concrete panels used at the entrance and around the windows. When it opened in 1956, the station was segregated by race, with separate waiting rooms, bathrooms, and drinking fountains. The Charleston Station was razed in 2018.

It was run for most of its history by African American manager Damon Ireland Thomas (1875-1955). For a time it was the only theater in the city where black patrons sat without restrictions. The Lincoln hosted movies, vaudeville troupes, public speakers, and local acts. It closed c.1971 and was razed in 1989 after sustaining damage from Hurricane Hugo.

The barracks was the most prominent feature of a Marine footprint at the base that reached 58 acres by 1924 and shrank to 23 acres by 1964. (Reverse) This two-story masonry building sits on a raised basement and exemplifies the Classical Revival style of many early 20th century structures on the base. Marines conducted drills on the open grassed yard to the building’s south, used as a parade ground after a larger yard to the east was developed prior to WWII.

Navy personnel, shipyard workers, and their families first received on-site medical care in tents until a dispensary opened in 1908. U.S. entry into WWI prompted construction of the base’s first hospital, a series of one-story wooden structures where injured soldiers and others received treatment. (Reverse) The larger, more modern 1942 hospital was built to serve the shipyard’s growing workforce. By 1945, the district spanned more than 30 acrea and included the hospital with treatment wards and administrative and subsistence buildings, housing for nurses and medical officers, and other facilities.

(Front) Robert Smalls School was built in 1953 as a segregated school for African American students. Construction was funded as part of South Carolina’s school equalization program. While both white and black schools were funded by this program, the purpose was to equalize African American educational facilities and conform with the doctrine of “separate but equal” in order to avoid racial integration. (Reverse) Designed by the firm of Hopkins, Baker & Gill of Florence, S.C., the school’s Colonial Revival aesthetic was heavily influenced by Cheraw, Incorporated, a group of local leaders who worked to ensure that new construction in the area was consistent with Cheraw’s historic character. The architecture of the building sets it apart from other equalization schools, which were usually built in a mid-century modern style. Sponsored by Pathfinders United, 2015

The two-story frame school with a bell tower, built in 1889-1890, was called “one of the most handsome and imposing” buildings in Manning. By 1899, however, the school was in debt and the building and property were endangered. The family of Moses Levi (1826-1899), farmer, merchant, and civic leader, bought it, cleared the debt, and donated it to the town. (Reverse) The school, renamed the Moses Levi Memorial Institute, operated here 1899-1910.

SCOTT’S BRANCH ELEMENTARY/MIDDLE SCHOOL, NW CORNER OF 4TH STREET AND LARRY KING HWY., SUMMERTON 
(Front) Preivously located at Taw Caw Baptist Church outside Summerton and at a site on 1st St., Scott’s Branch School moved here 1937-38. The first school at this site was a white, ten-room, frame building and enrolled African American students in grades 1-11. The current campus, completed in 1952, was the first school built through S.C.’s equalization program, a statewide effort to preserve segregation by upgrading black schools. (Reverse) In the late 1940s, Scott’s Branch School became the focal point of petitions and lawsuits filed by local African Americans to secure equal resources for black pupils in Summerton schools. Facing fierce opposition, 20 families ultimately sued to desegregate local schools in 1950. These efforts, led by Rev. Joseph A. DeLaine and the NAACP, resulted in Briggs v. Elliott (1951), first among five cases that in 1954 led the U.S. Supreme Court to declare segregated schooling unconstitutional.

BRIGGS FAMILY HOUSE (Front) On November 11, 1949, local African American families came to this house to sign a petition demanding equal resources in Summerton’s racially segregated schools. Believing the home’s isolated location offer safety, NAACP leader Rev. Joseph A. DeLaine requested its use from owners Harry Sr. (1913-1986) and Eliza Briggs (1917-1998) who with their children were the first of 107 people to sign the petition. BRIGGS V. ELLIOTT (Reverse) The action taken here culminated in Briggs v. Elliott, named for lead plaintiff Harry Briggs Sr., and one of five cases that in 1954 led the U.S. Supreme Court to declare segregated schooling unconstitutional. Like others who signed the petition, the Briggs family faced retaliation. Harry and Eliza both lost their jobs, and the family was forced to leave the state to find opportunity. They returned to Summerton in 1976, living here at the home they had built in the 1940s. Sponsored by Summerton Community Action Group, 2020

PEARSON FAMILY HOMESITE (Front) This farm was home to the family of Levi Pearson (1894-1970), who with his brother, Hammett Pearson, joined other African American parents in Davis Station and Jordan protesting Clarendon Co. Schools' refusal in the mid-1940s to transport their children to Scott’s Branch H.S. (7.7 mi. W) in Summerton. For several years, parents jointly bought, maintained, and drove their own bus without county support. PEARSON V. CLARENDON CO. (Reverse) On June 22, 1947, Rev. J.A. DeLaine came here and recruited Levi Pearson to file an NAACP-backed lawsuit for equal transportation in the county’s segregated schools. Though dismissed, Pearson v. Clarendon Co. led to one of the five cases decided in the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark ruling, Brown v. Board of Education (1954). Despite local backlash, Pearson never moved from this lot, bought in 1933. Sponsored by Summerton Community Action Group, 2020

(Front) In 1885, sixty-five former members of Liberty Hill A.M.E. Church (3 mi. SE) organized this congregation to have a church closer to their homes. They first met in a small frame building that fronted Main Street. In 1905, members bought the old Summerton Presbyterian Church building and had it moved to this site, razing the old church. That second church was destroyed in 1915. Congregants then built a third frame church, which was 1-story with a 2-story central bell tower. (Reverse) In the 1940s, St. Mark A.M.E. became an important site for NAACP-led efforts challenging inequality and segregation in Summerton schools. Long associated with Scott’s Branch School, which was located just N of the church before moving to 4th Street, St. Mark A.M.E. hosted fundraisers, rallies, and public meetings that culminated in Briggs v. Elliott, one of five cases decided in the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1954 ruling that school segregation is unconstitutional. Sponsored by Summerton Community Action Group, 2020

AVIATION WAY, AT THE LOWCOUNTRY REGIONAL AIRPORT, WALTERBORO ANDERSON FIELD (Front) This airfield, the first in Colleton County, was built and dedicated in 1933 on 60 acres leased to the town of Walterboro by the estate of C. C. Anderson, for whom it was named. By 1937 the town purchased the field and its 3 unpaved landing strips. Local, state, and federal sources combined to fund a large hangar and paved runways by 1941. The U.S. Army Air Corps leased the field from the town in early 1942 and purchased an additional 3,712 acres to create a new Walterboro Army Air Field. WALTERBORO ARMY AIR FIELD (Reverse) The Walterboro Army Air Field, opened in August 1942, was a sub-base of the Columbia Army Air Base and the largest sub-base in the 3rd Air Force. It served as a final training base for pilots prior to overseas duty and housed a military population of as many as 6,000 as well as hundreds of German POWs. When the base closed after the war the field was deeded back to Walterboro and Colleton County.

CORNER OF HAMPTON ST. (S.C. HWY. 63) AND S. WALTER ST., WALTERBORO 
(Front) The original section of this courthouse, completed in 1822 after the county seat moved to Walterborough from Jacksonborough, was built by contractor William Thompson. The front portico is attributed to Robert Mills, who completed an unfinished design by William Jay. The courthouse was in such poor condition within a few years, however, that it was extensively renovated in 1843-44. (Revere) This courthouse, listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, is built of brick covered in stucco to imitate stone. It was enlarged in 1916 by a frame wing on the west elevation. In 1937-39 a project of the Works Progress Administration covered the west wing with brick, built a new brick wing on the east elevation and an addition on the north entrance, and remodeled the interior.

(Front) This church, originally located at Jacksonboro, was founded in 1728 by Rev. Archibald Stobo (d. 1741), father of the Presbyterian church in S.C. The first building at Jacksonboro was replaced in 1746 by a “handsome sanctuary” that stood until it was destroyed by a forest fire in 1886. A summer chapel built on this site in 1821 was a branch of the Jacksonboro church. (Reverse) By the 1830s the Walterboro church became the main sanctuary under the leadership of Rev. Edward Palmer (1788-1882), minister here 1827-32, 1844-45, and 1862-74. A second frame church, built here in 1860-61, was destroyed by a tornado in 1879. It was replaced by another frame church in 1880, which burned in 1966. The present brick sanctuary, the fourth on this site, was built in 1969.

Many of the first “Tuskegee Airmen” had already won distinction and fame in missions over North Africa, Sicily, and Italy in 1943-44, and several of them were assigned here as combat flight instructors. (Reverse) Trainees here flew the P-39, P-47, and P-40 fighter planes and the B-25 bomber. The officers’ quarters and enlisted men’s barracks stood just east and just west of this spot, respectively. Segregation on American military posts, in place until 1948, was made worse by the fact that German POWs held here could use “White” facilities but the “Colored” officers and men of the U.S. Army Air Corps could not.

In 1954 it was renamed Colleton High and remained in use until 1970 when Colleton County schools were desegregated. During World War II the school was temporary home of 
the USO established for ue by black servicemen, including the Tuskegee Airmen, who were trained at Walterboro Army Airfield. 
GRUBER STREET USO (Reverse) In 1944 a federal grant allowed for the construction of a purpose-built USO for black servicemen. Built adjacent to the original Colleton Training School it included an auditorium and dance floor. The USO hosted weekly dances, live music, and games. It was necessary to have a USO for black soldiers because other facilities in Walterboro were segregated and did not admit black troops. After the war the building was repurposed for use by Colleton Training School. Sponsored by the Colleton Training School/Colleton High School Alumni Association, Inc., 2019

Constructed to replace a smaller water tower at the Colleton Co. Courthouse (.3 mi. W), it stands 132-feet-tall and has a capacity of 100,000 gallons. When in operation, its water supply was steam-pumped from a reservoir after being drawn from an artesian well. (Reverse) In 1930, the town council had three cells added to the tower’s base and used it as a jail. In the years that followed, the tower became a Walterboro landmark. Young residents made a tradition of the climbing the tower until an exterior ladder was removed in the 1970s. The town stored water in the tower until 2009, when it was decommissioned and replaced. It is one of the last towers of its type and era that survives in S.C. Sponsored by City of Walterboro, 2019

After the town complied with conditions set by Mr. Carnegie, he donated $5,000 and C. F. Bass of Latta gave land for the building, which opened as the Latta Library in 1914. Voters in a valid election levied a tax for maintenance. A rear portion and north wing were added later. (Reverse) This library initially served the Latta area and its schools, but in 1929 extended its service to all Dillon County schools. The cost led the library board to ask the county to provide aid. The county complied, although local control of library service continued. By statutory provision in 1973 a county library providing for countywide control was established; the Latta Library is the base of this operation. Erected by Latta Rotary Club, 1979

FORD’S MILL & PAGE’S MILL (Front) In 1792 Major William Ford built a dam at each end of Bear Swamp, creating a millpond and building a grist mill. This area was known as Ford’s Mill for many years. In 1870 Dr. C.T. Ford sold the property to his brother-in-law, Joseph N. Page, who soon opened a large general store. The community was renamed Page’s Mill, and in 1877 a post office was opened with J.N. Page as its first postmaster. LAKE VIEW (Reverse) After the railroad came through this area in 1900 the town of Page’s Mill grew from the mill, general store, and post office toward the railroad tracks. The town of Page’s Mill was incorporated February 26, 1907.

(Front) This camp ground, established about 1870, is the largest of 4 Methodist camp grounds in Dorchester County. Tradition holds that Ceasar Wolfe and a group of former slaves, caught in a storm, stopped in a grove here for shelter. Rice planter S.M. Knight asked them to help harvest his fields, and after they did so he gave them this spot as a place of worship. They named it Shady Grove. (Reverse) The group first met under a brush arbor but later built “tents,” the rough-hewn cabins typical of church camp grounds. The first tents burned in 1958 and were replaced; fires also occurred in 1969 and 1976.

(Front) This town, in Colleton County before Dorchester was founded in 1897, dates to the early 19th century and the origins of railroading in S.C. By 1843, only ten years after the S.C. Canal & Rail Road Company completed its first 133 miles of track from Charleston to Hamburg, the station here was called Ross, sometimes known as Ross’s, Ross’s Station, or Ross’s Turnout. The post office established here in 1854 was called Elmville until Reconstruction. 
(Reverse) The railroad, later the S.C. RR and by 1899 part of the Southern Railway, kept a station, a “turnout” or second set of tracks, and a water tower here for more than 100 years. It carried wood, turpentine, pulpwood, and livestock, and was instrumental in the town’s development. The post office here was renamed Ross Station by 1875, then renamed Dorchester in 1903.

BADHAM HOUSE (Front) This Neoclassical Revival house, called “one of the finest” in S.C. in 1920, was built in 1912 for Vernon Cosby Badham (1856-1947) and his second wife Lelia Johnston. Badham, a native of N.C., moved to S.C. in the 1880s and sold sawmill machinery in this area. In 1901 he built the Dorchester Lumber Company, across the highway and on the Southern Railway. The sawmill cut 50,000-100,000 feet of timber a day, hauling it from the swamps by a narrow-gauge railroad. DORCHESTER LUMBER COMPANY (Reverse) The sawmill, in operation from 1901 to 1938, employed 500 men at its peak. A large complex here included a company office, company store, worker housing, a school, and a church. The post office active here 1901-1945 was called Badham. Dorchester Lumber Company shut down during the Depression, and all that remains of the old mill across the highway is the brick ruin of the vault from the mill office.

BACON’S BRIDGE RD. (S.C. HWY. 165) NEAR THE ASHLEY RIVER, SUMMERVILLE VICINITY 
BACON’S BRIDGE (Front) An early bridge over the Ashley River near this site, built ca. 1696-1700, was first owned by John Stevens. Stevens sold this tract to Michael Bacon soon afterwards. Bacon’s Bridge became a public bridge in 1722. During the American Revolution, Patriot and British/Loyalist commanders in the lowcountry considered Bacon’s Bridge a strategic location. “THE HILL” (Reverse) In Feb. 1780 Gen. William Moultrie built an earthwork nearby to defend the bridge and the approaches to Charleston. Gen. Nathanael Greene’s Southern Army, including Gen. Francis Marion’s militia, camped at Bacon’s Bridge March-July 1782. In 1850 Rev. Robert I. Limehouse (1815-1881), later intendant of Summerville, built a house on the redoubt and named his plantation “The Hill.” Sponsored by the Summerville Preservation Society, 2014

18-20 RIDGEVILLE 
RIDGEVILLE (Front) This town, in Colleton County before Dorchester County was founded in 1897, dates from 1831. It was one of the first stations on the S.C. Rail Road from Charleston to Hamburg. This area was called Ridgeville as early as 1820, for its location on a ridge between Four Holes Swamp and Cypress 
Swamp. From the 1840s to the Civil War Ridgeville was a popular destination for “pleasure parties,” day trips up from Charleston and back on the S.C. Rail Road. (Reverse) Town lots were laid out and sold here in 1849, and the town became a planters’ summer retreat and a center of trade. One antebellum visitor called Ridgeville “a very pleasant, healthy village” and its citizens “industrious, prosperous and hospitable.” It was incorporated in 1875, with its limits a half-mile radius from the depot. The town was centered along Railroad Ave. and Main St. The timber and turpentine industries here flourished into the 20th century. Sponsored by the Upper Dorchester County Historical Society, 2013

NEAR INTERSECTION OF S.C. HWY 178 AND N. RAILROAD AVE., HARLEYVILLE 
(Front) Harleyville is named for the Harley family who owned much of the land that comprises the present town. William “Cow Bill” Harley owned substantial property in this vicinity and raised cattle for the Charleston market. In 1885 he sold a right of way across his land to the Eutawville Railroad, which built a road between Pregnall’s and Eutaw Springs with Harleyville a regular stop. The railroad spurred development of the lumber industry and the town was incorporated in 1893. (Reverse) As automobile travel became more popular in the 20th century, Harleyville again benefitted from its location along what was then one of S.C.’s main thoroughfares. S.C. Hwy. 2 (now Hwy. 178) was the first hard-surfaced road in Dorchester County. When completed in 1932 it extended from upstate S.C. to Charleston. Considered “S.C.’s Main St.,” Hwy. 2 allowed Harleyville to remain a trading center for surrounding farms. I-26 replaced S.C. Hwy. 2 as a main highway in the 1960s.

TEA FARM RD. NEAR THE INTERSECTION WITH ALT. RT. 17, SUMMERVILLE 
(Front) In 1880 the U.S. government leased 200 acres of the former Newington Plantation from Henry Middleton for tea production. In 1888, Dr. Charles Shepard, a professor at the Medical College of S.C., used plants from the federal farm to create “Pinehurst,” the first commercially viable tea farm in America. Production rose from 98 pounds in 1892 to 12,000 pounds in 1907. (Reverse) Shepard imported exotic plants to create beautiful gardens and roadways at Pinehurst. He established a school to educate the tea pickers’ children. Dignitaries such as Teddy Roosevelt visited Pinehurst. Charles Shepard died in 1915 and tea production ceased in 1919 when the tea factory burned. In 1995 the S.C. General Assembly made tea the “Hospitality Beverage of S.C.” Sponsored by the Summerville Preservation Society, 2016

Canal and Railroad known as “George’s Station.” It was named for James George (1789-1867), a plantation owner who gave land for the station when the railroad was built in the 1830s. He is believed to have operated a store in the area as early as 1810. The town was officially incorporated as George’s Station in 1875 and was re-incorporated St. George’s in 1889. In 1897, it was chosen as the seat of newly created Dorchester County. (Reverse) The new name recalled the old colonial parish of St. George’s, Dorchester, as well as the town’s founder, James George. The postal service first shortened the name to “St. George,” which came into common use by mid-century. By 1910, the town was a commercial hub with two banks, two hotels, several mills, and numerous stores. The construction of U.S. Hwy. 15 in the 1920s brought even more business and traffic, as it was along the most direct route from New York to Miami.

JAMESTOWN COMMUNITY, S.C. HWY. 24 NEAR ITS INTERSECTION WITH JAMESTOWN RD., MARS BLUFF VICINITY 
(Front) This African American community, which flourished here for 70 years, has its origins in a 105-acre tract bought in 1870 by former slave Ervin James (1815-1872). James, determined to own his own farm instead of being dependent on sharecropping or tenant farming, bought the tract from Eli McKissick and Mary Poston. His five sons and a son-in-law later divided the tract into individual farms. (Reverse) Between 1870 and 1940 Ervin James’s descendants and other area families purchased additional land, creating a rural community of about 250 residents. Among its institutions were the Jamestown Cemetery, dating from its earliest days; the Summerville Methodist Church (renamed Bowers Chapel), established about 1880; and the Summerville Elementary School, built in 1926.

Thomas Humphries (d. 1820), who served this and other area circuits, conducted the first service. In 1813 Dempsey Russell donated an acre to the congregation, which soon built a frame building here as its first permanent church. (Reverse) The church, often called “Russell’s Meeting House” or “Russell’s Church” for Dempsey Russell, changed its name to Pisgah Methodist Church in 1840. It moved to a site a few miles west after the Civil War but soon returned to this site and built a larger frame church in 1878-79. The present church, built in 1914, is a fine example of the Carpenter Gothic architectural style. Erected by the Congregation, 2006

(Front) In 1958, in the midst of the Cold War, the U.S. Air Force accidentally dropped an atomic bomb near here. The unarmed 7,600-lb., 10’8”-long bomb was aboard a B-47E bomber on a training mission headed for England. Its high-explosive trigger detonated on impact, making a crater as large as 35 feet deep and 70 feet wide. (Reverse) The bomb landed in the woods behind the asbestos-shingle-sided home of railroad conductor Walter “Bill” Gregg (b. 1921). Gregg, his wife, their three children, and a niece were injured by the concussion, which destroyed the house and outbuildings and did slight damage to buildings within a 5 mile radius.

(Front) This house was built in 1846 for Evander A. Gregg (1818-1874), a planter in what was Marion District. Its high masonry basement and porch form, indigenous to northeastern S.C., make it a fine example of a raised Carolina cottage. It was acquired by R.L. Singletary (1830-1910) in 1867 and by J.W. Wallace (1861-1928) in 1912. The plantation was named Red Doe in the 1930s. (Reverse) “Red Doe” refers to an incident during the Revolution when Patriot scout Andrew Hunter escaped on “Red Doe,” the horse of Loyalist Col. David Fanning. Red Doe, restored by Chisolm and Annie Wallace in 1940, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In 2006 Robert P. Wilkins donated it to a nonprofit group for preservation.

Several residents served under Francis Marion during the Revolution. By the 1820s this community was sometimes called “the crossroads” for the intersection of two major roads (one from Georgetown to Camden, the other from Charleston to Cheraw), now Main and Church Streets. (Reverse) This area was known as “Graham’s Crossroads” for Aaron Graham, who built a house here ca. 1830. The post office opened here in 1848 was named “Lynches Lake.” The town grew after the Northeastern RR was completed in 1857 and was chartered as Graham in 1874. Renamed Lake City in 1883, it was in Williamsburg County until 1912. Its tobacco market, opened in 1899, was among the largest in S.C. Its bean market, opened in 1936, was once the largest in the world. Erected by the Florence City and County Historical Commission, 2009

CORNER OF PALMETTO & DARGAN STS., FLORENCE WILSON SCHOOL (Front) Wilson School, later Wilson High School, was the first public school in Florence, and stood here from 1866 to 1906. At first a private school for black children, it was established by the New England Branch of the Freedmen’s Union Commission and operated by the Freedmen’s Bureau. Thomas C. Cox, its first principal, later served as Darlington County sheriff. The school became a public school after the S.C. Constitution of 1868 authorized a system of free public schools. 
WILSON HIGH SCHOOL (Reverse) Rev. Joshua E. Wilson (1844-1915), a Methodist minister, was an early principal of what was long called “the Colored Graded School.” It was most likely named Wilson School for him. The school on this site, a frame building, was torn down in 1906 to make was for Central School. A new Wilson School was built on Athens Street.

Frazier Baker, an African American who had recently been appointed postmaster of Effingham, was appointed postmaster of Lake City in 1897. Whites who resented Baker harassed him, even burning the post office in an attempt to make him resign and leave town. An old school on this site became a temporary post office and Baker’s home. (Reverse) On the night of Feb. 21-22, 1898, a mob set the house on fire and shot Baker and his family when they ran out. Baker and a baby daughter were killed, his wife and three of their children were wounded, and an editorial called it “the most horrible crime ever committed” in S.C.

LAKE CITY TOBACCO MARKETS (Front) Farmers in this vicinity began growing tobacco in the early 1890s, and by 1895 Lake City opened its first tobacco market and warehouse. It built its second warehouse by 1903, a third by 1909, and two more by 1917. In the heart of the S.C. “tobacco belt,” this was the second-largest market in the state for most of the 20th century, and one of the largest in the five states producing flue-cured tobacco. IMPERIAL TOBACCO COMPANY (Reverse) This building was built in 1912 for the Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland to redry and process tobacco after it was sold and before it was aged in warehouses. Imperial bought and processed flue-cured tobacco in five Southern states for most of the 20th century. This plant, once the largest redrying plant in S.C., was sold to T.S.

The market revived in the late 1920s and flourished during the Depression, when it shipped beans, squash, cucumbers, peas, and other vegetables. Lake City was one of the largest truck markets in the U.S. and claimed to be the largest string-bean or snap-bean market in the world. LAKE CITY BEAN MARKET (Reverse) This building, originally called “the Lake City Municipal Auction Market,” was built in 1936 with assistance from the Public Works Administration.

After completing his internship at Spartanburg General, he returned to Lake City where he practiced medicine for 55 years. In 1938 he oversaw the construction of this two-story building, which was built as a 14-bed obstetric hospital. With few other local options for professional medical care, however, Whitehead Infirmary quickly became the primary acute care facility in town. (Reverse) Whitehead Infirmary was established at a time when childbirth was increasingly occurring outside of the home. By 1950 the majority of U.S. births took place in hospitals and Whitehead Infirmary was part of this shift in medical practice. In addition to obstetrics, Dr. Whitehead also performed general surgery and treated numerous victims of traumatic injuries. The infirmary closed in 1959, but Whitehead maintained a clinic here until his retirement in 1986. Sponsored by Lynches Lake Historical Society, 2014

On Sept. 5, 1934 the bank was robbed by three armed men. The bank had larger than normal deposits on hand because it was the height of tobacco marketing season and the group stole a reported $114,082. Frank English and his wife Geneva were the only people tried for the crime. (Reverse) At trial it was alleged that English was an associate of George “Baby Face” Nelson, and that the notorious criminal was involved in the crime, but that was never proven. Frank English was sentenced to 25 years and Geneva English received one year as an accessory. Palmetto State failed due to the robbery, but depositors were repaid by the newly established FDIC.

21-46 TIMMONSVILLE 
100 BLOCK OF E. MAIN ST., TIMMONSVILLE 
(Front) Timmonsville was founded in 1852 and named for Rev. J. Morgan Timmons. Initial growth was spurred by the Wilmington and Manchester R.R., which carried cotton and forest productions to the port of Wilmington. J.M. Timmons established a turpentine distillery by 1854 and a steam-powered saw mill produced 5,000 feet of plank in that same year. The Timmonsville Tobacco Warehouse Co. organized in 1895, placing Timmonsville at the center of the growing Pee Dee tobacco belt. (Reverse) A fire in 1901 burned much of the downtown. Driven by profits from the tobacco industry, the town rebuilt and by 1910 population had doubled. The Atlantic Coast Line R.R., which absorbed the W.M.R.R. in 1898, built a brick depot on Railroad (now Main) St. The Seaboard Air Line R.R. was operating a second line through Timmonsville by 1914, testament to its place as the third largest tobacco market in the state. Leaf factories and warehouses all serviced the industry. Sponsored by the Town of Timmonsville, 2017

ON DARLINGTON STREET, EAST OF INTERSECTION WITH N. DARGAN ST. 
FRANK MANDEVILLE ROGERS, JR. (Front) Frank Mandeville Rogers Jr. (1857-1945) of Florence Co. was influential in the development of Bright Leaf Tobacco in S.C. In 1884-85, he raised, cured, and sold a plot of tobacco on his Mars Bluff plantation, proving its potential to replace cotton as S.C.’s top cash crop. Rogers built a tobacco factory on Day St. and led efforts to open S.C.’s first tobacco auction warehouse, helping revitalize S.C.’s agricultural market economy. FLORENCE TOBACCO WAREHOUSE COMPANY (Reverse) The first auction in S.C. of flue-cured tobacco occurred on this site in Oct. 1891 at the Florence Tobacco Warehouse. Nearly 300 people attended. Before the Warehouse, Pee Dee farmers had to ship their crop to N.C. and Va. To sell. Other local markets opened soon after. By 1900, the Pee Dee produced over 90 percent of S.C.’s annual 20 million pound tobacco crop, leading The State to call the plant, “the Pearl of the Pee Dee.” Sponsored by Florence County Museum, 2019

Cheves St., adjacent to his personal residence. To allow for the Infirmary’s expansion in 1916, McLeod had that wood frame home moved to this site. He and his wife Caroline Nelson McLeod (1878-1952) lived here in the old frame house until the brick house was built next to it. (Reverse) The McLeod House is a fine example of a four-square Prairie style home with Neoclassical details. While living here, F.H.

A native of England, he ministered to the Baptists there before migrating to Maine, establishing a Baptist church in Kittery, Maine, in 1682. By 1698, he had led his church to Charleston, S.C. He later moved to Georgetown, exerting his Christian influence until his death in 1713. ELISHA SCREVEN (Reverse) Elisha Screven, founder of Georgetown, was a younger son of William, who owned and lived his final years on these Winyah lands. To promote settlement here, Elisha planned a town, to be called Georgetown, which reserved lots for Anglican, Presbyterian, and Baptist churches, as well as for a school and other public buildings. Retained in the plan was this Screven family cemetery. The town had been laid out by 1730.

(Front) Early settlement in this area near the Black River, based primarily on the Indian trade and the production of naval stores, prompted the creation of Prince George Winyah Parish in 1721. When the first Anglican church to serve the parish was built in 1726 Governor Francis Nicholson made a donation toward its construction. The Rev. Thomas Morritt became the first rector of Prince George Winyah in 1728. PRINCE FREDERICK’S PARISH (1734) (Reverse) Within a few years successful rice production and the growth of Georgetown helped expand settlement inland and prompted the creation of a new parish. Prince Frederick's Parish included this area when it was established in 1734. A new parish church for Prince George Winyah was built in Georgetown by 1747 and the sanctuary here served Prince Frederick's Parish until a new parish church was built near the Pee Dee River in 1837.

(Front) 732 Prince Street was the home of William Doyle Morgan (1853-1938), mayor 1891-1906 and the catalyst for much of Georgetown's growth and prosperity by the turn of the century. He helped give the city what one observer called "the snap and vim of twentieth century progress," such as a modern water and sewer system, electric lights, macadamized streets, sidewalks, a deepened harbor, and jetties in Winyah Bay. (Reverse) When Morgan retired in 1906 citizens presented him a sterling silver punch bowl in recognition of his "Zeal and Energy" and "Untiring Efforts for the Improvement of the City and Her Harbor." He founded and was president of the Bank of Georgetown 1891-1927.

Mills himself, who also designed the Washington Monument, called this courthouse "a great ornament to the town." A modern Mills scholar has described it as "the most sophisticated of his South Carolina courthouses." (Reverse) An initial appropriation of $12,000 was approved for the new courthouse. The South Carolina Board of Commissioners for Public Buildings, including John Keith and Abraham Cohen of Georgetown, supervised its construction by contractor Russell Warren.

GROUNDS OF BROOKGREEN GARDENS, 1931 BROOKGREEN DRIVE, MURRELLS INLET 
(Front) Title to the land that comprised Brookgreen Plantation is traced to a patent for 48,000 acres granted to Robert Daniell in 1711. The property passed to the Allston family when William Allston bought it in c. 1740. William Allston Jr. acquired it in 1764 and developed it as his home plantation. By 1799 title had passed to Joshua Ward, whose son, Joshua John Ward, was born here in 1800. (Reverse) Joshua John Ward was active in the Winyah and All Saints Agricultural Society and was noted for his development of long-grain rice. He would become among the wealthiest planters in the nation. In 1850 Ward’s plantations, including Brookgreen, yielded 3,900,000 pounds of rice on land cultivated by 1,092 enslaved laborers. Ward and his descendants lived here until 1938. Sponsored by National Society of Colonial Dames XVII Century, Chicora Chapter, 2014

(Front) Many Waccamaw Neck planters summered at the seashore from late May to early November to escape the malarial swamps of the rice fields. DeBordieu and Pawleys Islands were favorite destinations. Summer cottages were usually built on the banks of the early marsh behind the island. These early homes were constructed on high brick foundations that stood above the rise of gale tides along the creek. (Reverse) Much of what is now DeBordieu Beach was owned by William Alston, who built two seashore houses here by 1800. Each May, Alston and other planters would move their entire households to the shore. Furniture, bedding, and provisions were packed first into boats and then transferred to wagon to complete the journey via narrow carriage roads.

231 KING ST., GEORGETOWN 
(Front) In the 1870s, this was the home of James Alfred Bowley (c.1844-1891). Born enslaved in Maryland, Bowley was the great nephew of Harriet Tubman (c.1822-1913). In 1850, Tubman and Bowley’s free father organized a plan to free Bowley and his mother and sister, making them the first enslaved people who Tubman helped emancipate. Bowley attended school in Philadelphia before rejoining his family in Canada. During the Civil War, he served as a landsman in the United States Navy. (Reverse) After the war, Bowley moved to Georgetown and worked for the Freedmen’s Bureau as a teacher. By 1870, he had married Laura Clark (1854-1932) and lived at this location. They sold the home in 1880. Bowley served in the S.C. House (1869-1874) and was trustee for the University of S.C. when it was briefly integrated. In 1874, a rivalry with another black Republican led to a violent clash that made national news. Bowley also founded the short-lived Georgetown Planet newspaper.

(Front) In 1946, the Groegtown Ministerial Association resolved to erect a place of Christian worship for summer residents on Pawleys Island. Partnering with the local Laymen’s Evangelistic Club to secure a building, trustees incorporated the Pawleys Island House of Worship in 1947. That same year, they acquired this lot and the old Georgetown Holiness Pentecostal church, which was disassembled, brought here, and rebuilt.

NE, used by planter families to escape seasonal malaria on local riverfront plantations, many along what is now Plantersville Road. Left behind were large workforces of enslaved people of African descent, whose isolation nurtured the development of “Gullah,” a West African-rooted language and culture found throughout the Lowcountry. (Reverse) Each summer, some enslaved people were taken to work in the village, but most remained on plantations. There, they grew rice using knowledge and skills with West African roots, enriching area planters. In the late 19th and early 20th c., freed people and their descendants formed new communities around old Plantersville, including Jackson Village, Annie Village, and St. Paul’s.

(Front) Fountain Inn Cemetery was established c. 1890. Most of the land was deeded to the town by Lafayette Martin, and his son, D.R. Martin, sold an adjoining parcel in 1924 to expand the cemetery. An earlier graveyard had been located adjacent to First Baptist Church, but as the town expanded the decision was made to establish a new cemetery at this spot and transfer the previous burials to this location. (Reverse) The various grave markers found here illustrate how burial practices evolved through time. The monuments and obelisks offer witness to Victorian sentimentality while the more uniform granite headstones that became popular by the mid-20th century show that the cemetery has remained in use over multiple generations.

(Reverse) By 1922 the H.S. had become an accredited public school. In 1938 WPA funds were used to build a new school complex. One of these buildings still stands north of the current school. Further consolidation led to the closure of Fork Shoals H.S. in 1952, after which the buildings were used as an elementary school. Two of three 1930s buildings were razed in 1998 when the current school was built. Sponsored by the Fork Shoals Historical Society, 2016

23-74 CLAUSSEN BAKERY 
400 AUGUSTA ST., GREENVILLE 
(Front) This two-story trapezoidal plan industrial building is one of two surviving Claussen bakeries in S.C. Built in 1930, the bakery initially employed forty workers who produced 45,000 loaves of bread a day. In February 1967 twenty-two African American employees, including organizer and spokesman Horace Butler Sr., who would later serve as the first African American foreman at the bakery, went on strike to protest discrimination in hiring and promotion practices. (Reverse) The Greenville branch of the NAACP, led by Rev. D.C. Francis, called for a boycott of Claussen baked goods in protest. Jesse Jackson, then working as director of SCLC’s Operation Breadbasket, helped bring Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Greenville. On April 30, 1967 King spoke to a crowd of 3,500 at Greenville Memorial Auditorium. King preached economic justice and support for the Clausen workers who “had been called boys...then they stood up like men.” Sponsored by Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society, the Greater Sullivan Neighborhood, and the Greenville Branch of the NAACP, 2016

CORNER OF GREENVILLE ST., LEE ST., AND PIEDMONT HWY. (S.C.-20), PIEDMONT 
(Front) Rose Hill cemetery was established in 1876 by the Piedmont Manufacturing Co., an early textile mill that began production in that same year. Originally known as Piedmont Cemetery, the earliest known burial dates to 1877. The cemetery served as final resting place for mill workers and their families, as well as members of the broader community, from 1876 until the mill’s closure in 1977. (Reverse) The cemetery expanded in 1922 when G.W. McAbee donated three-and-a-half acres of land for burials. Oral tradition holds that the cemetery was named “Rose Hill” in honor of McAbee’s daughter, Rose May McAbee Norris, who died in 1922 and is buried here. Other notable burials include local newspaper editor and mill supervisor Albert Smith Rowell. In 1995 title transferred to the Rose Hill Cemetery Association, which continues to maintain the cemetery. Sponsored by the Bonnes Amies Club of Piedmont S.C., 2016

(Front) William E. Earle acquired much of the land now bounded by Beattie Pl., N. Church, Academy, and E. North Sts. at a foreclosure sale in 1869. He subdivided the land and sold the parcels. Much of the land was purchased by African Americans, including Milton Brooks, a 30-year-old laborer who bought the first lot in 1872. The community grew from about a dozen families in 1876 to become a neighborhood of more than 75 houses by the 1920s. Little Texas developed just south of Allen School. (Reverse) Allen School, which had its origins as a Freedmen’s school in the 1860s, was a fixture of the neighborhood until a new Allen School was built on Stone Ave. in 1936. Memorial Auditorium was built adjacent to Little Texas in 1958. As the city continued to expand, Little Texas would succumb to the pressures of urban development. In 1971 the city condemned 65 homes in order to use the land for future development, effectively marking the end of Little Texas. Sponsored by Greenville Arena District Board of Directors, 2016

(Front) Around 1910 a group of Jewish families began to meet for Orthodox services in their homes and rented halls around Greenville. Within two years these recent Eastern European immigrants hired Charles Zaglin as their rabbi and kosher butcher. Congregation Beth Israel was incorporated in 1916 and was Greenville’s earliest chartered Jewish organization. The first synagogue was built on Townes Street in 1929. (Reverse) In 1957 Beth Israel, which affiliated with the Conservative movement in 1954, began construction of its second synagogue. The campus was built in two stages, with the Davis Social Hall, classrooms, and offices built in the first stage. By 1970 the second stage, including a chapel donated by the Heller family, was completed. Max Heller was a past president of Beth Israel and mayor of Greenville, 1971 to 1979.

110 FORK SHOALS CHURCH RD., PELZER 
(Front) Fork Shoals Baptist Church traces its origins to at least 1789, when Horse Creek Church was organized as a member of the Bethel Association. Local tradition, however, places the date earlier, between 1777-1780. Fork Shoals first appears in the Bethel Association minutes in 1799, when the Big Branch Enoree and Horse Creek Churches merged with Fork Shoals Baptist Church. (Reverse) By 1857 church membership had grown to 510 and in 1860 Fork Shoals was a founding member of the Greenville Baptist Association. Also in that year, Micajah Berry deeded the land on which the current church is built. The first sanctuary on this site was completed in 1888. While the current sanctuary dates to 1961, components of the 1888 structure were retained. Seven area churches began as the result of the ministry of Fork Shoals Baptist Church.

10 GATES ST., GREENVILLE 
(Front) Originally established as the Gates Desk Company in 1893, the mill was renovated and re-chartered as Carolina Cotton Mills in 1900. Mill ownership built 123 homes to house supervisors and workers, as well as a church and later a school. In 1916 the mill was reorganized as Poinsett Mill, named for S.C. statesman Joel Poinsett, who was an early advocate of southern industry. In 1928 Brandon, Woodruff, Renfrew, and Poinsett Mills merged to become Brandon Corporation. (Reverse) In the spring of 1929 mill hands at Poinsett joined workers from Brandon Mill in an 8-week strike to protest what they called “the stretchout,” an attempt by management to increase workloads in the face of declining wages. The strike ended when the mill agreed to minimal reforms. Abney Mills gained control of Poinsett in 1949 and owned it until the mill closed in 1981. The Reynolds Co., a producer of adhesives and coatings, acquired the former textile mill in 1983. Sponsored by the Reynolds Company and the Poinsett Historic Society, 2017

(Front) Bryson H.S. opened in 1954, serving African American students in lower Greenville Co. It was one of the many schools constructed in the 1950s as part of the school equalization program in S.C. The school consolidated the populations from five high schools, all that had inadequate facilities. The new Bryson H.S. featured a gym, auditorium, industrial and agricultural shops, home economics laboratories, and library. First serving grades 7-12, in 1958 they began serving grades 8-12. (Reverse) Dr. A.M. Anderson was the first and only principal. More than 1,000 students graduated from Bryson under his watch. The school mascot was the Hurricane and the newspaper was the Hurricane Times. The class of 1970 was the last to graduate. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the U.S. government put more pressure on the states to finally implement school desegregation. In 1970 S.C. schools complied.

The patriarch of the family, David Garrison, settled here in the 1780s and operated a grist mill on the Saluda River along what became known as Garrison Shoals. A marker for Garrison is located here, though the actual site of his burial is unknown. (Reverse) The first known burial occurred in 1853, when Barksdale Dunham Garrison, a veteran of the War of 1812 who achieved the rank of Brig. Gen., was buried here.

105 MILLS AVE., GREENVILLE 
(Front) The Wilkins House was built in 1878 by Greenville builder Jacob Cagle for William Wilkins and his wife Harriett Cleveland Wilkins. The home, which originally fronted Augusta St., was designed in the Italianate style, but also incorporated Gothic and Moorish elements. The interior finishes, including complex millwork and Lincrusta wall coverings, matched the high style of the exterior. An 1898 article declared it “the finest home of any man in northern South Carolina.” (Reverse) William Wilkins died in 1895 but Harriett lived here until her death in 1930. In 1933 the house was leased by the Wilkins family to R.D. Jones, who used it as both a residence and funeral home. When the home was threatened with demolition in 2014 a public fundraising campaign, along with the efforts of a new owner, combined to raise enough money to move the 750-ton building to its current site. At the time, it was believed to be the heaviest building ever moved in S.C. Sponsored by the City of Greenville, 2017

26-21 SONNY’S PAVILION 
INTERSECTION OF N. OCEAN BLVD. & SEA MOUNTAIN HWY., CHERRY GROVE, NORTH MYRTLE BEACH 
(Front) Sonny’s Pavilion, built in 1949 by N.F. “Sonny” Nixon, was an open-air pavilion on the Grand Strand. The rhythm & blues of the post-World War II era—later called beach music—was played on jukeboxes at area pavilions where dancers perfected the Shag, named the state dance in 1984. Beach music was named the state popular music in 2001. Nixon bought a small gazebo here and added a jukebox in 1947, then built a large pavilion here in 1949. (Reverse) Ocean Drive had a strict midnight curfew for its clubs, but Cherry Grove did not, and Sonny’s became a favorite of late-night shaggers from midnight to dawn. Sonny’s was one of several area pavilions destroyed by Hurricane Hazel in 1954, but Nixon rebuilt it the next year. It remained popular with shaggers and other fans of beach music until it became a family arcade in the 1970s. Sonny’s was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Erected by the O.D.

(Front) A succession of four beach pavilions stood here or nearby from 1902 to 2006, all built by the Burroughs & Chapin Co. or the Myrtle Beach Farms Co. The first, built in 1902, was a simple oceanfront shelter. The second, built in 1907, was a frame building 1 1/2 blocks from the beach. The third pavilion, a two-story frame building, was built here in 1923. An amusement park added in the 1930s grew to more than 11 acres. (Reverse) The 1923 pavilion burned in 1944 and was replaced by a two-story concrete pavilion in 1949. Dancing at these and other pavilions evolved into the Shag, named the state dance in 1984. The 1949 pavilion’s “Magic Attic” hosted bands and other acts; its jukebox, on the promenade’s dance floor, played the rhythm & blues of the post-World War II era, later called Beach Music. The pavilion closed and was demolished in 2006. Erected by the O.D. Pavilion Social and Shag Club, 2009

(Front) This marker stands adjacent to the burial ground of the former Ark Plantation, which dates back to the 1700s. Although the names of most of those buried here are now unknown, records indicate that it was primarily a cemetery for African Americans who lived at the Ark. In 1860, 63 slaves were recorded as living here. Descendants of those buried here continued to utilize the cemetery until 1952. (Reverse) Sabe Rutledge, who was born in the 1860s at the Ark, requested to be buried here and was so in 1952. Although town maps reserved two blocks as Ark Cemetery, in 1980 a circuit court judge ruled against those who claimed that the property was a cemetery and decreed the property free and clear of any claims by the defendants. Development of the property soon followed that court ruling. Documented evidence of the site now exists. Sponsored by the Town of Surfside Beach, 2019

It was a stop on the “Chitlin’ Circuit,” nightclubs where black entertainers such as Billie Holiday, the Mills Brothers, Little Richard, Ruth Brown, Otis Redding, and the Drifters performed during the era of racial segregation. While the club is gone, the Fitzgerald Motel, built in 1948, remains. The motel served black entertainers and travelers who could not stay in whites-only hotels. (Reverse) Oral tradition holds that “the Shag,” a form of southern swing dancing, originated here. Both white and black customers gathered here to listen to music and dance. In 1950 the Ku Klux Klan led a parade through “The Hill,” the African American neighborhood where Charlie’s Place was located. The Klan returned later and shots were fired into the club, injuring many. Charlie was severely beaten but survived. Some Klansmen were charged, but no one was prosecuted.

The seat of Lancaster District from 1800 to 1868, it has been the seat of Lancaster County since then. The town and county were named for Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the home of the Scots-Irish families who moved to this part of the South Carolina backcountry by the 1750s. Lancaster was the only incorporated town in the county until after the Civil War. (Reverse) The town grew rapidly as upcountry cotton production increased between 1800 and 1830, but grew more slowly for the next fifty years. Lancaster, revitalized by the arrival of the railroad in the 1880s and the rise of the textile industry in the 1890s, was described as “delightful and flourishing” in 1900.

By 1837 the Haile Gold Mine included a 5-stamp mill, with steel stamps or pestles that crushed ore into dust from which gold was extracted. Haile leased small plots to entrepreneurs who used slave labor to mine gold. (Reverse) The mine was not successful until the 1880s, when its owners hired Adolf Thies (1832-1917), a German mining engineer who perfected a new extraction process. A 60-stamp mill processed 100 tons a day, producing more gold than any mine east of the Mississippi. After a deadly boiler explosion in 1908, the mine closed in 1912. It operated briefly during World Wars I and II and the 1990s. Erected by the Lancaster County Historical Commission, 2004

Backcountry Patriots organized a resistance in response, with an important camp ½ mi. E at Clems Branch of Sugar Creek, on the wagon road from Camden to Charlotte. SUMTER’S CAMP AT CLEMS BRANCH (Reverse) In June 1780 Col. Thomas Sumter’s troops were among the few organized Patriot units in S.C. The camp at Clems Branch gave him a strategic location, water, and forage while reinforcements joined him in late June and early July.

Leroy Springs (1861-1931) for $25,000 and renamed the Lancaster & Chester Railway. A narrow gauge line, running only 29 miles from Chester to Lancaster, it was later converted to standard gauge track in 1902 at a cost of $125,000. (Reverse) The L&C carried freight and passengers 1896-1913 but only freight after a 1913 accident. Springs’s son Elliott White Springs (1896-1959) succeeded him as President. He named 29 Vice Presidents, one for each mile of the road. This depot, built in 1951 and designed by Joe Croxton, included the L&C offices.

By 1935 the board acquired this site, with a two-story, seven-room frame house on a two-acre lot, for $1,500. The house, renovated and fitted with medical equipment, opened as Peoples Hospital in 1937. The building, later the Vincent Street Community Center after the hospital closed in 1952, was demolished in 1970 to build Vincent Street Park. Sponsored by the City of Newberry, 2014

36-27 FREDERICK NANCE HOUSE-OAK GROVE 
921 JESSICA AVE., NEWBERRY 
(Front) The Frederick Nance House-Oak Grove, is an early nineteenth-century Classical Revival home, distinct from other early architecture in Newberry for its scale and masonry construction. The home was built on land owned by Frederick Nance (1770-1840), a businessman, planter, and well-respected public official. Appointed Newberry’s Clerk of Court in 1794, Nance also served as S.C. Lt. Governor 1808-10 and State Senator 1812-19. (Reverse) Although the house now sits on just under two acres, it was once the center of a substantial plantation that was carved from a 785-acre land grant secured by Nance in 1813. The design of the home has been attributed to Robert Mills, who was born in Charleston in 1781 and was preeminent among the first generation of native-born American architects. The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Sponsored by the Newberry County Historical and Museum Society, 2014

The Lutheran college struggled during the Civil War and its aftermath as enrollment dropped and debts mounted. In 1869 it sold its main building and other property in Newberry at auction to pay its significant debts. (Reverse) Walhalla, with a large community of Germans who were primarily Lutherans, was chosen as a suitable home for the college, which retained the name Newberry. Under Josiah P. Smeltzer (1818-1887), president 1861-77, the college first occupied a building at Main and College Streets and then one at College and North Broad Streets.

(Front) The unfinished railroad tunnel cut into the SE face of Stumphouse Mtn. is the largest of three begun before the Civil War by the Blue Ridge Rail Road, for a line from Anderson, S.C., to Knoxville, Tenn. Work began in late 1853. About 1,500 Irish miners, who lived in the Tunnel Hill village atop the mountain, cut through blue granite with hand drills, hammers and chisels, and black powder. Four shafts meant miners could cut through ten rock faces at one time. (Reverse) Stumphouse Tunnel was the westernmost tunnel of the three; Middle Tunnel was 1/2 mi. SE and Saddle Tunnel was 1 3/4 mi. NE. The longest section of this tunnel is 1,600’ long, 25’ high, and 17’ wide. Work ceased in 1859 when the S.C. legislature refused to fund more construction. Clemson University acquired the tunnel in 1951 and cured blue cheese here for several years. Stumphouse Tunnel, long a tourist attraction, is managed by the City of Walhalla.

(Front) Fort Prince George, covered by Lake Keowee since 1968, was built nearby in 1753, near the unofficial boundary between Cherokee lands and white settlements. Across the Keowee River from the Cherokee Lower Town of Keowee, it was built to protect whites and Cherokees from the Creeks or other enemies and had been promised to the Cherokee “headmen” by Gov. James Glen since 1748. (Reverse) The fort, a palisaded earthwork with bastions on the corners, was manned by about 25 men. Conflict between its officers and Cherokees helped bring on the Cherokee War of 1760-61. Fort Prince George was abandoned in 1768 as relations between Great Britain and the colonies worsened. Archaeologists excavated the fort site in 1966-68 before Duke Power Company flooded the valley in 1968.

39-18 FORT HILL SLAVE AND CONVICT CEMETERY/WOODLAND CEMETERY CLEMSON UNIVERSITY 
WOODLAND CEMETERY, CLEMSON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS, CLEMSON 
FORT HILL SLAVE AND CONVICT CEMETERY (Front) African Americans enslaved at Fort Hill were buried along the hillside below the Calhoun family plot in graves marked only by field stones. The exact number of burials is unknown. Beginning in 1890, Clemson College leased prisoners, primarily African Americans, from the state to construct campus buildings. Until 1915, those who died during their incarceration were buried adjacent to the slave cemetery. WOODLAND CEMETERY CLEMSON UNIVERSITY (Reverse) Clemson University’s Woodland Cemetery began as statesman John C. Calhoun’s Fort Hill Plantation graveyard. Early maps show the hillside had been an orchard. The first known burial was a child, also named John C. Calhoun, who died in 1837. Clemson College laid out the present cemetery in 1924 as a graveyard for faculty and staff. Many prominent Clemson University leaders are buried here. Sponsored by Clemson University, 2016

39-19 FORT HILL SLAVE QUARTERS/CLEMSON COLLEGE CONVICT STOCKADE 
LEE HALL VICINITY, CLEMSON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS, CLEMSON 
FORT HILL SLAVE QUARTERS (Front) Located one-eighth mile from the main house, the Fort Hill slave quarters were described in 1849 as being “built of stone and joined together like barracks, with gardens attached.” Some 70-80 enslaved African Americans then lived at Fort Hill. In 1854, Andrew P. Calhoun moved to Fort Hill from Alabama with his property, including slaves. At his death in 1865, the estate included 139 enslaved African Americans. CLEMSON COLLEGE CONVICT STOCKADE (Reverse) In 1890, convicted laborers, mostly African Americans with sentences ranging from two months to life, were jailed in a prison stockade nearby. They cleared land, and made and laid bricks. They also dismantled the stone slave quarters to use as foundations for Clemson College’s earliest buildings, including the Chemistry Building, Main Administration Building, and faculty residences.

39-20 CHEROKEE VILLAGE OF ESSENECA/FORT HILL PLANTATION OF JOHN C. CALHOUN 
CALHOUN BOTTOMS, CLEMSON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS, CLEMSON 
CHEROKEE VILLAGE OF ESSENECA (Front) Native Americans inhabited this site prior to the American Revolution. In 1775 naturalist William Bartram described the Cherokee village of Esseneca as “situated on the east bank of Keowee,” later the Seneca River, with a council-house and chief’s house on the west shore. The Cherokee presence ended when Maj. Andrew Williamson ordered the town and food stores burned during the Cherokee War of 1776. FORT HILL PLANTATION OF JOHN C. CALHOUN (Reverse) Fort Hill Plantation covered some 1,100 acres. Enslaved African Americans cleared fields, terraced hillsides, and herded livestock. They also planted and harvested crops. The enslaved labor force included blacksmiths, carpenters, millers, and gardeners, along with domestics and field hands. The gristmill stream called Sawney’s Branch for enslaved laborer Sawney Calhoun was the Mill Creek, later renamed Hunnicutt Creek. Sponsored by Clemson University, 2016

39-22 PICKENS RAILROAD 
NEAR INTERSECTION OF RAILROAD ST. AND E. CEDAR ROCK ST., PICKENS 
(Front) The Easley-Pickens line was chartered in 1890 by the S.C. General Assembly. Construction of the line, which ran from Pickens to Easley, was completed in 1898. At Easley the Pickens Railroad joined the Southern Railway. Ex-governor John Gary Evans was a prominent booster for the Pickens Railroad and also one of its first passengers. The line was known as the “Pickens Doodle” because there was no turning track and the train would run backward to Easley and forward to Pickens. (Reverse) Passenger service was discontinued in 1928 and the primary users of the Pickens Railroad became Singer Manufacturing and Poinsett Lumber and Manufacturing Co. Singer built a sewing machine cabinet plant next to the line in the 1920s and in 1939 acquired both the Pickens Railroad and Poinsett Lumber, which they used to supply wood veneer. After more than a century of service, the last run from Pickens to Easley took place in April 2013. Sponsored by City of Pickens, 2017

39-23 CHEROKEE PATH 
N. MAIN ST. NEAR THE INTERSECTION WITH MT. OLIVET RD., SIX MILE 
(Front) The Cherokee Path was once part of an important trade network that connected the Upper, Middle, and Lower Cherokee towns in the west with English settlements at Charles Town and, later, inland outposts like Fort Congaree, in the east. In 1715 there were at least 60 Cherokee villages, totaling roughly 11,000 people, that were connected to the coast via this travel and trade corridor. The trade in deer hides was particularly important to the early Carolina economy. (Reverse)The Cherokee Path once passed through Six Mile, roughly approximating the current route of Main St. The town of Six Mile derived its name from its location along the Path, which was six miles east of the Cherokee town of Keowee and later the trading post at Fort Prince George, both of which are now submerged under the waters of Lake Keowee. During the Anglo-Cherokee Wars (1759-61, 1776-77) the Path was used as a supply line by British and colonial forces. Sponsored by the Town of Six Mile, 2018

39-24 EASTATOEE VALLEY 
INTERSECTION OF SHOOTING TREE RIDGE RD. AND CLEO CHAPMAN HWY., SUNSET 
(Front) Human settlement in this valley dates to the Clovis people, present as early as 13,000 years ago. By the early 1700s, the valley was part of a cluster of Cherokee Lower Towns. Near here was the town of Eastatoee, which had more than 200 houses c.1760. Valley residents included Cherokee leader Seroweh and European trader James Beamer, who interpreted and mediated with the Cherokee. (Reverse) Conflicts with Europeans and other tribes weaked Eastatoee, which was destroyed in 1760 and rebuilt. The Cherokee abandoned the town in 1776, when it was burned by Patriot forces. Sustained white settlement in the valley began in 1784, when the state first issued land grants in former Cherokee territory. Descendants of some of those 18th c. settlers still live in the valley.

INTERSECTION OF DURHAM MILL RD. AND WALHALLA HWY. (S.C.-183), PICKENS 
(Front) Seconee was the easternmost of the documented Cherokee Lower Towns in Upcountry S.C. Situated 1 mi. W in the broad floodplain at the confluence of Twelve Mile River and Town Creek, Seconee’s location offered fertile ground and access to several trails. It is one of the only Lower Town sites in Pickens Co. That was not later submerged under Lakes Hartwell, Jocassee, and Keowee. (Reverse) During the American Revolution, the Cherokees allied with the British. Patriot forces burned Seconee and several other nearby Lower Towns in 1776 during Col. Andrew Williamson’s campaign. Seconee had the ability to field 26 warriors, comparable to many other Cherokee towns. Nearby Secona Baptist Church and Town Creek were both named for their association with Seconee Town.

(Front) Columbia was founded in 1786, replacing Charleston as the state capital. The first State House here, built in 1789, was a small wooden building just W. of this site. Construction on this State House, designed by John R. Niernsee, began in 1855; exterior walls were almost complete when work was suspended in 1863 during the Civil War. In February 1865 Union troops burned the old State House, shelled this unfinished building, and raised the United States flag over it. (Reverse) Niernsee supervised postwar repairs and new work until his death in 1885. His partner J. Crawford Nielson succeeded him, followed by Niernsee's son Frank. In 1901 the General Assembly hired Frank P. Milburn, but often clashed with him over workmanship and his design for the present dome, a radical departure from J.R. Niernsee's original design. He was replaced by Charles C. Wilson in 1903. A major renovation by the firm of Stevens and Wilkinson was completed in August 1998.

(Front) In 1872 Samuel Barber (d. 1891) and his wife Harriet (d. 1899), both former slaves, bought 42 1/2 acres here from the S.C. Land Commission, established in 1869 to give freedmen and freedwomen the opportunity to own land. Barber, a well-digger as a slave, was a farmer and minister after the Civil War. The Barber family has owned a major portion of this tract since Samuel and Harriet Barber purchased it in 1872. (Reverse) Samuel Barber’s wife Harriet (d. 1899) received title to this land in 1879. This one-story frame house was built ca. 1880. The Barbers’ son Rev. John B. Barber (1872-1957) inherited the property in 1899. He was a schoolteacher and pastor of St. Mark and New Light Beulah Baptist churches. This house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

INTERSECTION OF BACK SWAMP RD. & LOWER RICHLAND BLVD. (S.C. SEC. RD. 40-37), HOPKINS 
(Front) This rural community grew up around the plantation of John Hopkins (1739-1775). Hopkins, a native of Virginia, settled here in 1764. A surveyor and planter, he was later a delegate to the First Provincial Congress of 1775. Between 1836 and 1842, when the South Carolina RR line from Kingville to Columbia was completed, a turntable was named “Hopkins’ Turnout” for the family. (Reverse) The Hopkins’ Turnout post office opened in 1849. After the Civil War many freedmen, freedwomen, and their families settled in the area, some farming land they had purchased during Reconstruction from the S.C. Land Commission. The completion of the Wilmington, Columbia, & Augusta RR in 1871 expanded area markets, until the agricultural depression of the 1920s weakened the local economy.

40-170 EASTOVER 
INTERSECTION OF MAIN ST. & WESTON ST., EASTOVER 
(Front) Eastover, so named for being “east and over” from Columbia, was a small rural community of the mid-19th century that grew into a town after the Wilmington, Columbia, & Augusta RR completed its line through this area in 1871. The town, chartered in 1880, was incorporated in 1907 with its limits designated as one-half mile in each direction from the tracks through the center of town. (Reverse) Railroad lines to and through Lower Richland County allowed local markets to expand and farmers and merchants to prosper. By 1910 Eastover, then the only incorporated town in the county outside of Columbia, boasted a post office, a bank, several stores, and a cotton gin. In 1984 Union Camp, later International Paper, opened a pulp and paper plant near the town. Erected by South East Rural Community Outreach, 2010

1800 BLOCK OF BLOSSOM ST., COLUMBIA 
(Front) This city park, established in 1911, was named for Confederate general Maxcy Gregg (1814-1862). It was one of several parks in Columbia proposed by landscape architect Harlan P. Kelsey of Boston, whose 1905 plan was commissioned by the Civic Improvement League. The park, donated to the city by George R. Rembert (1875-1913), was the central portion of a tract originally bounded by Bull, Wheat, and Greene Streets and the Southern Railway. (Reverse) The park was later divided by Pickens Street in the late 1930s and by the extension of Blossom Street in 1939. The Woman’s Club of Columbia (1941), across Blossom Street, was built in what was then still part of the park. The Memorial Youth Center, dedicated in 1948, was demolished in 1987. A swimming pool and bathhouse were dedicated in 1949. Recent additions include the Capital Senior Center (1995) and Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Garden (2003).

DREHER HIGH SCHOOL, 3319 MILLWOOD AVE., COLUMBIA 
REDFERN FIELD (Front) This is the site of Redfern Field, established in 1923 as the first commercial airfield in Columbia. Paul Rinaldo Redfern (1902-1927?) had shown an early interest in and aptitude for aviation, building his first full-scale airplane in 1916, while still a student at Columbia High School. Though he soon left high school to gain experience working on and flying planes, Redfern returned in 1919 and graduated in 1923. PAUL R. REDFERN (Reverse) Redfern built his own plane, opened his airfield here, and flew passengers all over S.C. before barnstorming across the Southeast for a few years. In 1927 businessmen in Brunswick, Ga., financed Redfern’s attempt to make the first solo flight from North America to South America. On August 25, he took off in the monoplane Port of Brunswick from that city, bound for Rio de Janeiro. Redfern, last seen over Venezuela, was never heard from again.

2081 DUTCH FORK RD., WHITE ROCK 
(Front) This church, organized in 1762 by German colonists, is one of the first Lutheran congregations in the Dutch Fork region. Incorporated in 1788 as “the German Lutheran Church of Bethel on High Hill Creek,” it first met in a log church 3.5 mi. S, near the juncture of that creek and the Saluda River. It built later churches ca. 1800, in 1843, and in 1881 further up High Hill Creek. (Reverse) An original member of the South Carolina Lutheran Synod when the synod was organized in 1824, Bethel was forced to move when Lake Murray was constructed. In 1929 it merged with Mt. Vernon Lutheran Church, organized in 1893 at White Rock, to form a “new” Bethel Evangelical Lutheran Church. This Gothic Revival church, designed by J.B. Urquhart of Columbia, was dedicated in 1930.

INSIDE FAIRGROUNDS, APPROX. 100 FT. SE OF ROSEWOOD AVE. ENTRANCE, COLUMBIA 
(Front) The S.C. State Fair was founded in 1856 by the State Agricultural Society. The fair was held at the fairgrounds on Elmwood Ave. near downtown Columbia 1856-1861, then suspended by the Civil War. The State Agricultural & Mechanical Society revived the fair in 1869; it stayed on Elmwood Ave. until 1903, when the society acquired 100 acres here for its “thoroughly modern” fairgrounds. The first State Fair held at this location opened in October 1904. (Reverse) The S.C. State Fair, with exhibits and competitions, attractions and rides, and musical and other acts, has been held here every fall since 1904 except during World War I in 1918. Other events are held year-round. A highlight from 1904 to 1959 was “Big Thursday,” the football game between the University of S.C. and Clemson University. The “rocket” near the North Gate, a U.S. Air Force missile given to the City of Columbia, has been an icon here since 1969. Sponsored by the South Carolina State Fair, 2013

Jackson (1927-2006), and eleven other adults and their children. The first church, a modest building, was called “the Little Red Church.” Jackson, its first pastor and later a bishop, served this church from 1963 until he retired in 1996. (Reverse) After the first church burned in 1966, services were held in Atlas Road Elementary School across the street until a new church was built here. That church, chartered as Bible Way Church of Arthurtown but later renamed Bible Way Church of Atlas Road, was dedicated in 1967.

From the 1940s until after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 they ran the house as a “tourist home” for black travelers. Harriett also taught at Waverly Elementary School. (Reverse) During the Jim Crow era, segregation gave African American travelers very few choices for restaurants or lodging. Many chose to stay in a network of private houses located across the South and nation.

(Front) Joseph Joyner owned a private ferry on the Congaree River near this site by 1749. John McCord’s private ferry succeeded Joyner’s by 1757, becoming public in 1766 by statute. A route from Charleston to Camden crossed the river at McCord’s Ferry. Due to its strategic location, the ferry figured in actions on the south side of the river during the Revolutionary War. (Reverse) As the river cut a new channel, isolating the oxbow lake now called Bates Old River, a second ferry was chartered in 1845. This ferry was operated by the Bates family from the Civil War until bridges replaced both crossings in the 1920s.

The current sanctuary, the second on this spot, was built in 1916. Zion Baptist has long served as a center for community organization. Both the Women’s Baptist Educational and Missionary Convention of S.C. (1888) and the Women’s Auxiliary to the Gethsemane Baptist Association (1919) were founded here, as were other important missions. (Reverse) In 1930 Dr. Matilda Evans, the first African American woman to have a practice in the state, started a free clinic in the basement of the church. It served 700 patients on its first day. On March 2, 1961 over 200 African American students met at Zion Baptist before beginning their march to the State House to protest racial segregation. The U.S. Supreme Court later overturned the convictions of those students arrested during the march in the case Edwards v. S.C. (1963). Sponsored by Zion Baptist Church, 2014

CONFEDERATE AVE., NEAR INTERSECTION WITH BULL ST., COLUMBIA 
(Front) The Confederate Infirmary opened here in 1909. S.C. was the last southern state to create a residence for indigent Civil War veterans. Legislation authorized space for two veterans from each county. The United Daughters of the Confederacy played a key role at the facility, which was renamed the Soldiers’ Home in 1915. The UDC prompted investigations that led to renovation of the Greek Revival building and nearby hospital in 1921. (Reverse) Women’s influence at the Soldiers’ Home continued and in 1921 the state authorized the UDC to name four women to the Home’s nine-person commission. In 1925 the state opened the Home to veterans’ widows, and later extended eligibility to sisters, daughters, and nieces. The last veteran living in the Home died in 1944 and it closed in 1957.

1200 BLOCK OF MAIN ST., COLUMBIA 
(Front) Due to Columbia’s strategic value, capture of the city was an objective of the Union Army during the Carolinas Campaign of 1865. By Feb. 15 Union forces had moved to within 4 miles of the city and met opposition from Confederate skirmishers and artillery batteries. After offering a cursory defense of the city, C.S.A. commanders P.G.T. Beauregard and Wade Hampton ordered a final evacuation of Columbia on the morning of Feb. 17, 1865 and by the afternoon Union forces occupied the town. (Reverse) By 1865 Columbia had become a central store of cotton in the Confederacy and as Union forces entered the city cotton bales lined much of Richardson (now Main) St. Several cotton fires were reported on the night of Feb. 16-17 and others were burning on the afternoon of Feb. 17. On the night of Feb. 17-18—aided by high winds, burning cotton, and Union soldiers—destroyed much of Columbia’s main commercial district and more than 450 buildings in all, a large portion of the city.

It served as showroom for DuPre Auto Co., a local distributor of Ford cars and Fordson tractors. The first commercially successful small tractor, the Fordson was produced by Ford Motor Co. from 1917-1928. During the first year of sales, DuPre Auto Co. placed over 700 Fordson tractors on S.C. farms, an important advance in pre-harvest mechanization in the state. (Reverse) By 1933 DuPre Auto Co. no longer operated from this location. The property housed engravers, equipment suppliers and manufacturers during the Depression. From 1943-1945, the Associated Press service bureau and Columbia Record newspaper occupied the building.

These founding members, like many African Americans at the time, sought greater autonomy by breaking from white-controlled churches. The congregation of First Calvary first organized under a brush arbor and later met in the home of Celia Mann, now the Mann-Simons Cottage. (Reverse) The congregation built a permanent home, a frame structure, on Richland St. c. 1870. They remained at that location until building a new stone sanctuary at Pine and Washington Sts., which was completed in 1950.

(Front) In 1883 members of Columbia’s Jewish community founded the Hebrew Cemetery Society of Columbia as an alternative to the Hebrew Benevolent Society’s cemetery, which had been established in 1822. The organization purchased a 4-acre tract bounded by Indigo (Whaley), Lower (Heyward), Marion, and Sumter streets as a free cemetery for Hebrew burials. In 1896 the Society sold 3 acres to W.B. Smith Whaley for textile mill development. (Reverse) By 1911 the Society deeded cemetery oversight to the Beth Shalom (House of Peace) synagogue. Early burials included Orthodox Jews from Columbia and elsewhere. This site later became identified as a place specifically for synagogue members. As the Univ. of S.C. expanded in the 1960s it grew around the cemetery. Jewish migration into Forest Acres and fewer available plots here led to the creation of Arcadia Lakes Cemetery in 1995.

Organized as Etz Chayim (Tree of Life), this group’s members embraced Judaism’s Reform branch or liberal movement. In 1907, members moved into the first temple built in Columbia since the Civil War. Located at 1320 Lady St., the synagogue was paid for by funds raised by local Jewish citizens. (Reverse) To meet the needs of their growing congregation, Tree of Life members began making plans for a new synagogue in 1950. Following a design by Columbia firm LBC&W, M.B. Kahn Construction erected a modern temple in 1952. The highly-touted, contemporary building was a unique addition to the Shandon neighborhood.

Jews embracing Orthodoxy formed a new synagogue, which they named Beth Shalom (House of Peace). Meetings were held in a private home on the corner of Park and Lady Sts. until a sanctuary was completed in 1907. Destroyed by fire in 1915, it was rebuilt eight months later. Growth of the congregation led to a new temple in 1928. (Reverse) Designed by noted Columbia firm Lafaye & Lafaye and built by M.B. Kahn, a member of the congregation, the new House of Peace was dedicated Sept. 8, 1935. In 1955, its members shifted from Orthodoxy to embrace the Conservative movement. For more than three decades the Marion St. landmark met the spiritual, cultural, and social needs of its members. In 1973 the congregation built a new synagogue on Trenholm Rd. in Forest Acres.

By 1915, the Church had acquired title to a lot at the S.E. corner of Wheat and Maple Sts. and was incorporated the next year. The first sanctuary was completed in Nov. 1916. The Rev. William Sumner Harden was the first minister. By the late 1920s the church had outgrown this building and construction began on a second sanctuary. (Reverse) Columbia firm Lafaye and Lafaye designed the second sanctuary, located at the present site on Woodrow St. It was completed in April 1929. The church building expanded in the 1950s, 1960s and 1990s, evidence of the growth of the congregation. In the 1950s, led by Rev. Dr. Fred V. Poag, the church actively supported racial desegregation. The congregation is still recognized for its local and global outreach. Sponsored by Shandon Presbyterian Church, PCUSA, 2016

DORN DR., WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN DORN VA HOSPITAL, COLUMBIA 
(Front) The Columbia Veterans Hospital opened to patients in 1932 and was among a set of VA Hospitals built throughout the nation. The campus is similar in design to other VA Hospitals of the period. Originally built with large day-rooms and open wards, the design was modified to include smaller patient rooms and private spaces as health care philosophy evolved. The siting of the hospital just outside the city helped to generate growth in the surrounding area. (Reverse) The VA attempted to reflect local history and local architecture in the design of its facilities. While the Colonial Revival style was similar to other VA hospitals, the Recreational Building (Bldg 5), with its raised basement, sweeping stairs, and monumental portico, may have taken inspiration from the Mills Building on the campus of the S.C. State Hospital. The facilities here were segregated by race until 1954, when the VA officially ended the practice. Sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017

GRANBY LANE, SW OF BLUFF RD., COLUMBIA VIC. 
(Front) The Olympia Cemetery was established c. 1904 and served the families of mill workers from Capital City, Richland, Granby, and Olympia Mills. The land was set aside by W.B. Smith Whaley & Co. When a death occurred the company would provide a burial plot. In 1944, Pacific Mills, which had purchased the Whaley Mills in 1915, deeded ownership to the Olympia Cemetery Association. The Association drew its members from the eight Olympia community churches. (Reverse) The oldest portion of the cemetery is the SW section, with more recent burials proceeding to the NE. Oral tradition holds that when a child in the community died, mill workers would build a wooden coffin, line it with material from the company store, and carry it to the gravesite.

(Front) From 1901 to 1905, this was a segregated park for African Americans, opened by the Columbia Electric Street Railway Company. Development in this part of Columbia, then known as “the highlands,” began in the 1890s with the extension of rail service from downtown. Following complaints from white riders traveling to nearby Hyatt Park, the company created Lincoln Park as part of its efforts to segregate the previously integrated rail line to the highlands. (Reverse) Black residents from across Columbia visited Lincoln Park for walks, picnics, musical performances, and camp meetings. Approx. 4,000 people attended the park’s formal opening in July 1901. It originally had an auditorium and outdoor theater. By 1903, Lincoln Park had been combined with Hyatt Park for the use of whites. In 1905, a Virginia-based firm bought 100 acres of surrounding land to develop the whites-only Park Place neighborhood and formally renamed this “Lake Park.” Sponsored by City of Columbia Parks and Recreation Department, 2021

15TH N.Y. INFANTRY (Front) The 15th N.Y. Infantry, a volunteer National Guard unit of African American soldiers, arrived here Oct. 10, 1917, to train at Camp Wadsworth. Race riots that summer in East St. Louis and Houston raised the fears of Spartanburg’s whites about the potential for racial violence if Northern black soldiers trained here. Though the 15th N.Y. was ordered not to respond to any insults or physical abuse by local whites, tensions rose for the next two weeks. “HARLEM HELL FIGHTERS” (Reverse) The War Dept., fearing that minor incidents would soon escalate, ordered the unit back to N.Y. on Oct. 24 and on to France. As the 369th U.S. Infantry, it joined the 4th French Army and its band won acclaim all over France for its concerts. It was the first American unit in combat, and was soon nicknamed “the Harlem Hell Fighters.” It was at the front for 191 days, longest of any American unit in World War I.

2200 RACING ROAD, GREER VICINITY 
(Front) This site was the location of active mill operations from 1837-2007. The core of the current mill building was completed in 1888, with subsequent additions enlarging the complex as operations expanded. The most notable of these came in 1903, just after Lewis Parker acquired the mill. The 1903 addition was designed by J.E. Sirrine and added 400 looms and 17,000 spindles. By 1907 Apalache Mill employed 300 workers who ran 500 looms and 20,000 spindles. (Reverse) The adjacent dam and mill pond were completed in 1904 and represented an important shift in how the mill was powered. The energy generated by the falling water as it dropped 40 feet from the mill pond to the South Tyger River below was harnessed by a 2,300 volt water wheel-driven generator and 75 H.P. induction motor. These, in turn, drove a series of belts and pulleys that powered mill equipment. Apalache Mill was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

(Front) In 1914, a federal hospital dedicated to discovering the cause of pellagra opened at this site. Run by the U.S. Public Health Service, the 3-story facility had a capacity of 30 patients before being expanded in 1916. Led by Dr. Joseph Goldberger (1874-1929), doctors worked to determine if pellagra was caused by diet, as opposed to bacterial infection. The disease was an epidemic in the South, particularly among mill workers like those in Spartanburg County. (Reverse) As part of their research, USPHS staff surveyed local mill workers and conducted experiments here, some on themselves. Their work helped link pellagra to a lack of meat, milk, fruit, and vegetables, foods that were often inaccessible to low-income southerners. The hospital treated patients from across S.C., providing healthy food and medical guidance. It closed in 1920. In 1937, niacin deficiency was shown to cause pellagra. Later, the disease was all but eradicated in the U.S. Sponsored by S.C. Osteopathic Society, Spartanburg County Medical Society, and Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, 2021

(Front) Sumter’s Jewish community, dating to 1815, has long been one of the largest and most influential in inland S.C. Mark Solomons, Franklin J. Moses, and Montgomery Moses brought their families to Sumter District from the old and well-established Jewish community in Charleston. Other families, from Spain, Germany, Poland, Russia, and other European nations, followed. Two organizations founded shortly after the Civil War would later join to form a congregation. (Reverse) The Hebrew Cemetery Society was founded in 1874, the Sumter Hebrew Benevolent Society was founded before 1881, and the two societies agreed to merge that year. A formal merger in 1895 created the Sumter Society of Israelites, the official name of Congregation Sinai. The first synagogue, a frame building constructed by 1900, burned. It was replaced in 1913 by this Moorish Revival brick synagogue, listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Erected by the Jewish Historical Society of South Carolina, 2009

THE BRITTON COMMUNITY (Front) Following his discharge from the Confederate Army, John James Britton began buying farm property on the Pocotaligo Swamp in 1864. His grandfather, Henry Britton, came to the Sumter area from Britton’s Neck (Marion County) in 1806. By the late 1800s J.J. Britton had built a large home on this road just north of this location. Farming continued as the main business until the early 1900s. BRITTON SIDING (Reverse) Beginning as a large-scale farming operation, John Bossard Britton, grandson of J.J. Britton, expanded the business to encompass other ventures, including a general store, cotton gin, planing mill, and fertilizer plant.

SHAW DRIVE, BUILDING 1505, SHAW AIR FORCE BASE, SUMTER 
(Front) Though the U.S. Supreme Court had declared racially segregated school unconstitutional in the landmark decision Brown v. Board (1954), school boards in much of the South maintained segregated school systems well into the 1960s. This included Sumter School District No. 2, which served families stationed at Shaw AFB. In 1963, 14 African American airmen from Shaw challenged the legality of the segregated system. (Reverse) The lead plaintiff was Col. James E. Randall, who had been a Tuskegee Airmen and flew missions in Korea and Vietnam, and renowned civil rights attorneys Matthew J. Perry and Ernest Finney Jr. argued the case. In Aug. 1964 the U.S. District Court ruled that Sumter County’s segregated school system violated the rights of the plaintiffs and ordered Sumter Co. to begin district-wide desegregation in the fall of 1965.

(Front) On April 20, 1861, only days after the Civil War began at Fort Sumter, scientist and aeronaut T.S.C. Lowe (1832-1913) landed the Enterprise, a large gas balloon, on a nearby farm. Lowe was on a test flight in preparation for a trans-Atlantic attempt. Southeasterly currents had carried him 800-900 miles by air from Cincinnati to Union District in less than nine hours. (Reverse) Many locals assumed that Lowe was a Yankee spy, and it was difficult for him to convince them that he was not. He was taken to Union and spent the night there under guard. Taken to Columbia, he was allowed to return north by train after several gentlemen vouched for his reputation as a scientist. Lowe later founded and directed a balloon corps in the U.S. Army in Virginia 1861-1863. Erected by the Union County Historical Society, 2009

N. ENTERPRISE ST. AND W. MAIN ST., IN FRONT OF UNION COUNTY JAIL, UNION 
(Front) In 1871, one of the worst waves of white supremacist violence in S.C. history unfolded in Union County. During two raids in Jan. and Feb. of that year, twelve Black men were forcibly taken from this jail by the Ku Klux Klan while awaiting trial. Most were members of the S.C. militia accursed of killing a white man. Ten men are known to have been shot or hanged to death in the two attacks. The fate of the other two is unknown. (Reverse) National press described the lynchings as “outrages” and “inhumane barbarities.” These murders and other acts of intimidation and violence aimed at disenfranchising Blacks led President Ulysses S. Grant to declare a state of rebellion in Union and either other S.C. counties. Danger and inequities led some Black families to leave Union Co., while others remained and built community institutions. Sponsored by Union County Community Remembrance Project, 2020.
